# ConstrainedMarkovModel
An implementation of a non-homogenous Markov model (constrained Markov model)

This model was built to supplement a paper in the context of mnemonic device generation, *“She Offered No Argument”: Constrained Probabilistic Modeling for Mnemonic Device Generation*. The paper can be read in the proceedings of ICCC 2019 ([here](http://computationalcreativity.net/iccc2019/assets/iccc_proceedings_2019.pdf#page=95)).

You can try the model out to create mnemonic devices at ISU's CCIL website [here](https://ccil.cs.isu.edu/projects/nhmmonic/).

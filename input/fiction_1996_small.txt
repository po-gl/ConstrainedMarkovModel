##1003587 The Love of Horses : Fiction <p> Horseback riding , that 's not a real sport . It 's so easy ! " said a girl in my carpool as my mom drove me to riding class . My body ahead with anger , but I do n't argue . My mom dropped the other kids off at the high school and kept driving toward the stable . <p> Soon we shot up the steep driveway of the stable , and my heart started beating wildly Right them I wanted to be riding over the high jumps - soaring . I scrambled out of the car and said good-bye to my mom . When I opened the door , I smelled the leather and fresh sawdust . Pure horsey heaven . <p> " Hey , Larkin , " said Nancy , the stable 's groom . I set my stuff down and ran toward my leased horse , Tags . I hugged him hard and led him into the grooming stall . <p> I groomed him for fifteen minutes and went to get my tack . The saddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ran my hand over them . I started to slowly walk back to the stall , being careful not to drop anything . I patted Tags and tightened the girth . I grabbed my colorful helmet and checked my watch . Oh , no ! If I did n't hurry I would be late . I quickly slipped the bridle over Tag 's head and walked into the ring . <p> Twenty minutes later I was trotting around the ring . My legs ached as I tried and tried to keep the weight in my heels , a well-known horseback riding rule . I tried to keep Tags going at a steady pace - not too fast and not too slow - but I was n't succeeding . My teacher , Elizabeth , told me to go to a sitting trot and then to the canter . I squeezed my left leg and Tags broke into a cancer . My legs moved around , but I fixed that . Elizabeth told me to go into the jumping position , and after one time around the ring , my back felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Elizabeth showed us a course to jump . I got scared . I trotted toward the cross-rail , got into the jumping position and soared over the jump . I looked toward the next jump and turned my body as I trotted forward . Again I got into jumping position and jumped the black gate , constantly thinking weight in the heels , jump in the middle , keep a steady pace . <p> I jumped a few more courses and Elizabeth said , " That 's enough for today . Walk him around until he 's cool . " I learned forward , very tired , and hugged Tags . I love riding and the smell of horses , the rhythm of the horse , the joy of riding . It is almost like riding is my life . I dismounted and led Tags out of the ring . I walked him back into the grooming stall and took the tack off . I thought about what happens if horse and rider do n't work together . You could fall off , or the horse could just plain learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tags stood there , totally relaxed . I went to clean the tack and said hi one of the dogs , Elory . <p> Ten minutes later , Tags was happily crunching his apple . <p> I grabbed my stuff and exclaimed , " Bye , Elizabeth . See you on Saturday . " As I walked out of the barn , I smiled and though about how fun my next lesson would be . <p> Illustration ( Larkin Barker with her horse ) <p>

##1003592 Monday morning <p> " Heresy ! Rank heresy ! " <p> The editor squeezed his hands together unhappily . " Come now , Geoffrey . Tom was merely being provocative . " <p> " Edward , why do you persist in ignoring the truth about this subversive ? Tom has just questioned whether we should continue to support the Anglo-American special relationship ! He 'll be telling us next that we should drum America out of NATo and rely on the French . " Hodgskin 's voice rose in a screech . " The French ! ! ! " <p> Tom St Loe Rathbone 's patronising drawl cut in . " Chill out , Geoffrey . I thought the whole point of editorial meetings was to think the unthinkable . " <p> Hodgskin drew himself up to his full six feet four . " There is the unthinkable and there is the unspeakable . And what is not speakable is the querying of our fixed principles . " <p> " In fairness , Geoffrey , " said the editor mildly , " our commitment to the Atlantic alliance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quivered . " For over a third of The Economist 's life a guiding principle has been the need to keep our allies from going back into Fortress usA . " <p> " Oh , for heaven 's sake , " said the editor irritably . " You know perfectly well Tom is just expressing his own personal opinion . We do n't necessarily agree with him . Just because he tilts at our sacred cows does n't mean the cows are n't sacred . " <p> Hodgskin 's voice rose to a scream . " With an editor who has chosen to abandon the monarchy , how can I have any faith that we will be true to our heritage ? " <p> The editor sighed . " We 've been through all that . Bagehot took a relaxed view on that over a century ago . " <p> " To be precise , " observed the Britain editor , " Bagehot said he did n't expect the monarchy to last much beyond his lifetime . " <p> " Bugger Bagehot , " said Rathbone . " Who cares what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Typical , " shouted Hodgskin . " Typical of your complete failure to appreciate . . " <p> Rathbone yawned . " Oh , for God 's sake , Jeffers , you 're carrying on as if we had abandoned free trade . Though I have to say I 've been wondering recently if protectionism might n't have the virtue of . . . " <p> " That 's it , " howled Hodgskin . " You infidel ! You apostate ! " He picked up his coffee-mug and threw it across the room at Rathbone . It bounced off the deputy editor 's shoulder and shattered against the window . As Hodgskin stormed out , the assembled staff showed no emotion . As one man they shrugged and moved on to discuss whether anything useful might emerge from the latest European Union summit . <p> Five minutes later , the luscious Julia Barrington , one of the editor 's secretaries , emerged from the lift into the lobby and stopped in mid-stride to stare through the plate-glass window at what looked like the corpse of Geoffrey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and metal . As she exclaimed with alarm , two passers-by materialised and helped Hodgskin to his feet . <p> " What 's happened , Zoe ? " <p> The receptionist tittered nervously . " I think Geoffrey has finally gone bonkers . He came charging out of the lift , rushed over to James . . . " She waved at the forbidding marble statue of the founder of The Economist that stared from a corner of the lobby , " . . . waved his arms at him , shouted something like It 'll be back to the Corn Laws next , ' rushed out the door and crashed straight into that .. that whassitsname . " She consulted a piece of paper . " Oh , yes . Fiscal Rectitude ' . Now , what 's been going on ? What have you been doing to him ? " " It 's not us , " protested Julia . " It 's him .

##1003594 I have been a collector and student of African-American literature and history for about 15 years . I 'm one of that strange breed of people my friend Charles Blockson lovingly refers to as " bibliophiles . " This year , I was fortunate to experience the thrill and satisfaction of discovering a hitherto unrecorded piece by an important writer whose work I collect . <p> I had recently acquired a large mixed bag of African-American fraternity and sorority material , mostly associated with Howard University , dating from about 1921 to 1930 . It was offered to me by a book-scout friend who knew that I collected work by Zora Neale Hurston , the most accomplished black woman writing in the first half of the 20th century . He told me that among all of the material , there were a couple of magazines with pieces by Hurston . <p> When the package arrived , I found not magazines but rather two sorority yearbooks . One , the December 1925 issue of The X-Ray : The Official Publication of Zeta Phi Beta Sorority , contained the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is unrecorded by Hurston 's biographer-bibliographer , Robert E. Hemenway . In a recent conversation , he confirmed that it is an original story , not something reworked in a later publication . <p> " Under the Bridge " is a typical Eatonville , Fla. , story . It captures the Southern folklore and the sounds of folk speech that Hurston grew up with in Eatonville , a self-governing all-black town that nurtured her sense of individuality . As in her other early stories , Hurston does not mention Eatonville by name . Nevertheless , it is abundantly clear that the piece is drawn from her youth there , much like " Spunk , " written the year before and published in the June 1925 issue of Opportunity magazine . There is really not much more to say here than , " Thank you , Zora , for another story . " -Wyatt Houston Day organized the first auction devoted entirely to printed and manuscript African-Americana , which was held at Swann Galleries , New York , on March 28 , 1996 . Based on the success of that sale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor of Black History Month . May-May in the Florida outdoors ; May in the open house of Luke Mimms and May in the hearts of the three occupants of the house . <p> Luke , the father-husband , was glowing . He was 58 and God had granted him a pretty wife one summer less 20 . His son , Artie the beloved , 22 , had accepted her at last and was at peace with Luke . The world was bright . Fifty-eight is young after all with love . <p> Vangie was radiating ecstasy from her black eyes and brown skin . She , the homeless waif , was loved by Luke . She was the mistress of his comfortable household and her big stepson had said he was glad she was there . For three weeks he had sulked in sullen silence . But now-since morning-he had not only permitted her to make up to him , he spent his leisure doing errands for her , or displaying his huge strength for her entertainment . <p> Artie laughed his deep baritone . He was at peace again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ogre he had pictured her before he looked at her . She was pretty . She was obliging and after all she was only a kid , grateful for any little kindness shown her . <p> " See , Dumplin ' , " Luke gloried , " did n't Ah say Artied be all right t'reckly ? Yas , mah boy is awful ' fectionate . He would n't hurt a flea-he kai n't stay ' way fum his pappy . " <p> Vangie patted Luke 's hand and scolded him prettily . <p> " It 's yo ' fault , Honey . You kept callin ' Artie ' yo ' baby ' an ' Ah thought he wuz a lil teeny baby chile . Ah never knowed he wuz bigger'n a house . No grown body do n't want no stepmama . If he wuz a lil boy , Ah figgered Ah 'd teach him to love me like he wuz mine . " " Do n't mind him , " Artie said . " He always calls me baby . ' Heah Ah is de stronges ' man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rassle since Ah wuz 16-but Ah 'm all he 's got-Ah mean till you came . " <p> " Kah ! Kah ! " Luke laughed boisterously . " Ef Ah had a ' tol ' you Ah had a son 22 , you would a ' thought Ah wuz ole . Dat Artie boy , he 's jealous uh me , dat 's whut-we been heah by ourselves since he wuz 9 . " <p> " Yeah , " Artie added- " It sho ' made me good and mad to think we been gettin ' ' long all dese years , den w'en Pop gets ' round 60 he got to jump up and get married . " <p> " Ai n't but 58 , " Luke threw in hastily . <p> " Whut 's the diffrence ? But Ah ai n't mad uh nothin ' no mo ' . If youse happy , Ah is . Vangie is a good girl an ' Ah 'll do all Ah kin to make it nice for her . Ah 'm glad not to be foolin ' wid the cookin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Artie did make things nice for Vangie . There was always plenty of stove wood in the wood box and water in the two brassbound pails . He " grubbed " potatoes for her , churned for her , took her fishing with him and even let her go hunting with him when he discovered her enthusiasm for dogs in general , and his pair of " redbone " hounds in particular . <p> May was burned to June beneath the Florida sun . Berries hung plump and green in clusters among the lacy chinaberry trees . The woods were full of color and odors . <p> June for Luke , for Artie , for Vangie-June in the world . <p> But Luke was not so happy as he had been . Not that he was jealous-he hated himself at the very thought of such a passion-but Artie and Vangie did seem to have a great deal to talk about in which he had no part . They could enjoy themselves for hours together and did not remember he was alone . Artie never seemed to go out " sparking " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forever calling him . Sometimes his great love for the two " young ' uns " would overflow and wash all baser passions from his soul . Then he would assure himself that all was well . He had prayed for peace and harmony between these two , and God had heard him . <p> " Youse mah wife , " Luke said to her one day at the table and closed his gnarled black hand upon her brown one . This was as near as he ever came to betraying the sore on his heart . Artie looked quickly at his father , searchingly . Vangie did not return the caress , but neither did she draw her hand away . So Luke was satisfied . " Artie , Baby , do n't think cause Ah married , dat you kai n't git yo ' shear . Youse haff an ' haff partners wid me on dis truckin ' farm-you kin take over yo ' 20 acres whenever you gits ready an ' git married when so evah you please . Pinkie Turk wuz jes ' axin ' ' bout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Ah reckon the place can stay together lak it t is . No hurry a-tall-Ah ai n't in no hurry to jump over de broomstick wid nobody . " <p> During supper that night the dogs were rather noisy-moonless black night with the alligators booming from Lake Belle and the whippoorwill crying in the orange grove <p> " Past-Ned , old boy , put ' im up ! " Artie called out to his " tree " hound . " Go git ' im , Beulah ! " to his " strike . " To Vangie he explained : " Them dogs knows it 's a good hunting night-b'leeve Ah 'll air ' em out if Ah kin git Pop to go ' long . " <p> " Nope , Son . Pop 's too tired . Git Dan Carter to go wid you . " <p> " Oh , lemme go wid you , Artie , " Vangie begged . " Ah ai n't never been in mah life . " <p> " Sure you kin , Vangie . " <p> " Naw , Dumplin ' , you better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ git snake-bit . " <p> " Shucks , she kin wear yo ' boots , " Artie put in . <p> " Oh , Ah wants to go ! " wailed the girl . <p> " But Honey , " Luke contended , " dey mought flush a catamount . " <p> " Aw , we ai n't goin ' in a hammock , " Artie retorted . So Luke , having offered every objection but the real one , gave in . <p> " You reckon any boogers goin ' ter git me , Artie ? You sho you kin take keer uh me ? " she appealed . <p> " Sho ' Ah kin take keer uh you , Vangie , and Ah would n't leave you go if Ah could n't . " <p> So Vangie drew on her husband 's boots and followed Artie into the black woods . <p> Luke crept to bed alone with the dishrag under his pillow-for that is a powerful charm to keep the marriage bed inviolate . <p> He heard the deep voices of the hounds " treeing " far away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two others returned , tired but happy . But Luke could never hear a baying hound again or look at a low , full moon without that painful heart contraction he had felt that night in the vastness of his bed alone while his wife strode thru the dark woods , depending upon , looking to someone other than himself for protection . <p> By eight o'clock next morning he trod the village road to End-Or . He hurried to the gate of Ned Bickerstaff to get a " hand . " <p> " Does you want dis han ' for hate , for to make money come to yuh , for to put yo ' enemy on his back , or to keep trouble fum yo ' do ' ? " the old male witch asked . <p> " Ah-Ah jes ' wants to fix it so 's nobody kai n't git ' tween me and Vangie . " " Does you want him daid , or crippled up fuh life , uh jes ' fixed so he kai n't stay heah ? " <p> " None of ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to sure there never been one . " <p> Bickerstaff made him a small parcel sewed up in red flannel and received $10 in return . <p> " Take dis , Luke Mimms . Long as you got dis , nobody ca n't never cross you . Wait till sundown , sprinkle it wid a drop or two of water and nobody kin git twixt you ' thout water gittin ' him . But do n't sprinkle it tell youse sho ' you wants somethin ' done , cause it 's bound to come after de sprinklin ' . And do n't never take it off once you put it , else it will work the other way . " <p> Luke hurried home to his fields and toiled vigorously all day beside his big brown boy Like the roots , his hands were gnarled ; like the soil , his skin was brownish black . Dirt of the dirt , he appeared to the observer . But like the moist black earth he worked , he held within everything of good and evil . He watched Artie from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big form that threw its shadow between Vangie and him ! How he loved his dear boy , his baby now grown to such splendid manhood ! Aha ! In his pocket was the little red bag that by its magic made their years equal and enlarged his shrunken old form to that of Artie , the brute magnificent . The dull brown earth clod was alive and warm with the fire of love and hate . So he sang in his quavering old voice : <p> " There 's a balm in Gilead <p> To make the wounded whole , <p> There is a balm in Gilead <p> To heal the sinsick soul . " <p> He trusted to his " hand " and grew cheerful again . <p> " Artie , le 's we all knock off now . Hit 's mighty hot an ' de bear 's bout to git me . Le 's put some ' millons tuh cool and drive in to town . " <p> " What fur ? Oh , all right , Pop , Ah 'll go feed de hauses and change up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whilst you puts de melons in de springhouse . " <p> Vangie waved them off cheerfully and went on with her work . <p> On the road they laughed , told jokes , commented on timber and crops , fertilizers and stock , laughed , and joked some more and finally arrived at Orlando . <p> Then Luke revealed the object of his trip . He wanted to buy things for Vangie . " Artie , she kin have everything to make a ' oman proud . " He stopped , embarrassed , for a moment . " You an ' her is the same in mah heart . You know Ah allus tried to give you what yo ' lil heart wanted . Ah allus ast Gawd to fit it so 's Ah could . To yo ' dyin ' day Ah wants it to be so . An ' now , wid her it 's the same . You-You doan ' mind , do you , Artie boy ? " <p> There was a childish , almost pathetic look in his eyes as he looked up into his son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breast . He put one arm quickly about his father 's shoulder , then drew it away and roughly tied the horse to the great oak tree . <p> " Oh , course , Papa , Ah wants you to do for Vangie whutever you so desired . You been a good papa to me . Ah wants you to be jes ' as happy as a king . Whut you got in yo ' mind to buy her ? " <p> They advanced to the door of the store . <p> " Well , Ah thought Ah 'd buy her a new churn , a store broom , and bolt uh new calliker . " <p> " You reckon she wants dat ? " Artie asked skeptically . <p> " Sho ! All womenfolks do . Ah useter give yo ' ma a bolt uh calliker ev'ry Chris-mas . " <p> He shopped eagerly , giggling like a schoolgirl . Artie shopped also , but his purchase was made without any flourish , in another part of the store , and Luke in his excitement asked no questions . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before leaving town Luke dismounted and bought a large stock of peppermint candy-red and white striped . <p> " She 'll be tickled to death to git dis candy , " Luke jubilated . <p> " You ought to 've got dat box kind of candy fuh her , " Artie commented gently . <p> " Whut ! Spen ' a whole dollah fuh a teeny lil box when Ah kin git dis great big stick fuh uh dime ? " <p> At home , Vangie had supper ready , and as soon as the horses were unhitched and fed , they gathered about the table . Then the old lover slyly arose and presented his gifts . First the churn , a big brown earthen affair-and Vangie exclaimed happily over it , but there was a little disappointment in her voice which Luke would have noticed had he not been so consumed by the joy of giving . Then the calico ; which she received a little happier , and last the broom and candy , upon which he bumped her mouth awkwardly with his own . <p> " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she told him . " Ah reckon Ah got de bestest husban ' in Floridy . " <p> Luke went beaming back to his seat . <p> Artie nonchalantly tossed a parcel in Vangie 's lap . <p> " Thass a lil somethin ' f'um me , too , Vangie . You been waitin ' on me and doin ' fuh me ever since you been heah , an ' Ah ai n't never give you a cent . Ah 'll be buyin ' you somethin ' all along if you keep on lookin ' after me . " <p> It turned out to be a white wool skirt and a pink silk blouse . Poor Vangie was delighted and could not keep the ecstasy out of her eyes and voice . <p> " Oh , oh , Artie ! " she cried , grasping his hand . " Youse so good to me ! " <p> She held the two garments up to measure and hugged them gleefully . <p> " Artie , Artie ! " she all but wept . " How you know whut mah heart wanted so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it fuh you , Vangie , if Ah had a knowed , " said Luke miserably and remained silent for the rest of the meal . That night Luke sprinkled his " hand " and put it on . <p> The old sun , so careless of human woes , shone brightly every day . If Luke wept in his hell of misgivings , the sun came up and sped across the blue , glorying hotly in its strength and power , just the same . Old trees rotted at the heart , and the sun nourished young saplings that quickly buried the struggling old forest monarch in their shadows . The sun went on and on to his sky bed at night , pulling the gray and purple hangings of his couch about him and slept , indifferent to human tears . <p> Artie and Vangie did nothing that Luke could put his finger upon as unfaithful . It was just their lowered eyes , their happy gazes that hurt him . He did not believe that they had desecrated his hearth , but he could feel their love like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin painfully as soon as he entered . He could not rage , he could not kill . He loved them both till it all but suffocated him . In this great love he saw they suffered too-that Artie loved him greatly , for he laid down his love for his father 's sake . But for how much longer ? Luke asked himself . <p> The sun flung August hotly down upon him . <p> Vangie dressed every Sunday in the skirt and blouse that Artie had bought her . Luke could only explain this by the fact that Artie had given them . He , of the calico age , could not understand the tastes of the age of silk . <p> Oh , the house was unbearable ! His suspicions had filled every chink and cranny . He began to approach sheltered places stealthily and creep thru the orange grove . Then he would hastily retreat lest he surprise them . <p> " Tell you whut , " he began one evening . " We kai n't do nothin ' to de crops fuh a week uh mo'le @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock on de pashcher an ' go on a fishin ' trip up de rivah ! " <p> " Ooh ! Le 's we all ! " Vangie echoed . <p> " Ah kin stan ' a whole heap uh dat , Papa . " Artie laughed and stretched his mighty limbs . " Le 's start t'morrer. " he awakening sun threw a flaming sword upon the St. John 's River the next morning as they embarked . <p> The camping necessities were piled high in the center of the large rowboat before Artie , who rowed . Vangie was perched in the low stern , facing him with Luke at his back in the high prow seat . <p> Downriver they flew under Artie 's mighty strokes . The sun lost its redness as it climbed . The hounds , with forepaws on the gunwale , barked defiances to river alligators , woods and would not be stilled in their freedom . <p> " How fur we goin ' , Artie ? " Vangie asked . <p> " Oh , way past de Coast Line ' bridge , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , Pop ? " <p> " Ah , sho ' , sho ' , " the old man answered . <p> " We been down there heaps uh times on account uh game , " Artie went on . " Dere 's panthers , catamounts , deers and bears in dem woods ' bout 20 miles off . " <p> " Ooh , Ah 'll be skeered , " Vangie shuddered . <p> " No need to be-Ah 'm heah , " Artie answered quickly . " Ole wile cat ' bout got me when Ah wuz a lil shaver but Papa kilt him-fought him wid his pocketknife-Ai n't he never tole you ? " <p> " Naw , indeedy , please-Luke , tell me . " <p> " Oh , tai n't much to tell , Vangie . Hit wuz in dese same woods we gwine to now . Artie allus did love to follow me ' round , traipsin ' ' long , holdin ' on to mah finger wid his lil fat han 's . His ma useter cry an ' say he loved me better'n he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set ' round in dem swamps an ' he cried to go , so Ah took him . Way down in dat hammock we flushed a wile cat an ' she leaped right at mah boy , but Ah wuz too quick fur her . Ah got in betwixt an ' she landed on me . An ' Ah had to fight wid mah han 's an ' a pocketknife . Ah kilt her , but she clawed me up so 's de doctah had to take a whole heap uh stitches . " <p> He displayed his arms and chest . <p> Vangie 's eyes grew misty . <p> " An ' fuh dat , " Artie said flippantly , but with a husky voice , " Ah 'm goin ' ter let him be mah papa till Ah die . " <p> They all laughed excessively to hide their feelings . <p> The sun quieted the dogs , sweated the people , and fried the paint on the boat . <p> Artie rowed on , his tremendous muscles bunching , stretching , bunching , stretching , as he bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Negro melodies rolled out of his chest in deep baritone and rumbled over the river to be lost among the trees . Deep vibrating tones , high quavering minors . He sang on and on , filling Vangie 's ears with his music , her eyes with his body and her heart with love of him . <p> Luke saw it all . His son 's back was toward him , huge , huge , till it swelled and swelled until it blotted out the boat , the river , the woods , the earth , the sun for Luke . The universe held nothing but Artie singing to Vangie and caressing her with his eyes . His old skin pricked and crept uncomfortably . <p> But , he gloated , the " hand " would hold . They could but bruise themselves against the bars . <p> Hell ? Yes . Fire ? No . Just one woman , two men in a boat-two men who love her-two men who love each other . <p> They suffer from the heat-Artie , rowing , most of all . Vangie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Artie 's head under his hat . His arteries swell , her hand trembles . Their faces are close-their lips nearly meet . Involuntarily Luke grasps for his " hand " and all but faints . It was gone . God knows where . String must have worn in two . <p> The two hours for Luke crawled on up the river and over him with hot brassy feet . The sun was arching toward his bed . <p> " Ah 'm tired , " Vangie gasped . <p> " Not much longer now , " Artie comforted her . " Wese goin ' ter camp jes ' beyon ' de bridge-'bout three miles mo ' . " <p> " Luke 's ' sleep , " Vangie observed . <p> Artie glanced over his shoulder- " Guess ' t is pretty hahd on de ole man . We 'll camp soon . " <p> But Luke was not asleep . He slumped there with closed eyes lest they see his tears . His first wife had been merely a good worker-he had never loved any woman but Vangie . His whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Artie might know nothing but happiness . And now , that which would give Artie happiness would at one stroke rob him of both wife and son ! His heart contracted so painfully that he gasped and opened his eyes . <p> The bitterness of life struck him afresh . He blamed them . He did n't . Poor creatures ! Designing devils ! He closed his eyes again . <p> The bridge was in sight . And now he noticed the sun was setting . The sky darkened ; the fleecy clouds soaked up more color and yet more-magenta , purple , blush , rose with light shafts hurled across the heavens from the west as if the sky monarch on retiring would disperse his train . <p> With every pull on the oars , Artie leaned nearer to Vangie and she , forgetting , was leaning toward him . He , with the rebirth of the world in his eyes-the eternal torch lighter . She inclining her taper to his light with closed eyes and all-consuming love . All who ran might read . <p> The bridge was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river . As they shot under , a train rushed screeching overhead . Here in the darkness , Artie drew in the oars and let the boat drift slowly . His hand touched Vangie 's , his feverish lips touched her hungry ones , and lazily , slowly the boat was wafted out again into the light . <p> They saw at once that Luke was not-and both fell a-weeping . Artie forgot his oars and the boat floated where it would upon the stream . <p> The indifferent sun , in bed , drew round his purple curtain and slept . <p> On the river they wept on . The boat drifted on , for Destiny , the grim steersman , had seized the rudder and they were bound-whither ? <p> 
##1003596 Once there was a town called Mouse Town . It was a happy town with mice going back and forth . But the happiest time was when lt . it was Christmas . It was a big celebration . Everyone would gather around the big , sparkling tree . Everyone would decorate it . <p> Here was the best part : THE CHRISTMAS CRUMBS All the mice would gather around and nibble on a berry or a nut . But the mice did not er &joy; themselves that much because there was one problem . One Mouse celebrated Hanukkah . But this mouse did not have a menorah , the special candleholder used to celebrate Hanukkah . At Christmas , he would just sit inside , sadly watching all the other mice . The mice felt very bad for him . <p> One wise mouse had an idea . He ran out into the forest and bit nine branches off a small bush . He tied them together , and then twisted and turned them until they looked just like a menorah . Then he rubbed two sticks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran back to Mouse Town with the menorah , placed it on a table , and hid . <p> The mouse that celebrated Hanukkah saw the candle 's light .

Then he sat down and started to eat the Christmas crumbs , or Hanukkah crumbs , I should say ! <p> 
##1003598 I never saw my Grandma so upset as the day the geese ate the cherries . You see , in the old Hungarian villages of Transylvania , * geese are much more important than vampires . You raise them for special occasions . Grandma always kept geese and looked forward to holidays . <p> It was nearly holiday time , but Grandma was not acting like it . She was shouting and crying at the same time . <p> " Draga Nagymama ! Dear Grandmother ! " we said , crying with her . " Tell us again how the geese all died , " we begged . <p> Her face was red and puffy from crying . Grandma wiped her eyes and tried to tell us again . " It was the cherries . I think they were poisoned , " she explained in her Hungarian way while waving her hands . <p> " Poisoned cherries ! How could it be ? " I , her biggest and strongest granddaughter , asked as I smoothed her gray hair from her forehead . " Who would poison the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I do know this , " she said . " The cherries are gone and the geese are dead . " " Where are the geese now ? " I pleaded with her . <p> She raised her arm and pointed way back through the fields , where the people of the village put their animals if they had died of some sickness . <p> My heart pounded in my chest . I could not even think about Nagymama 's beautiful geese lying there in that cemetery with the other animals . <p> She was very sad the entire day . Grandpa tried to cheer her up , but it did n't help . All she would say is " Ohhhhhhh .... " " Tell us again , Nagymama , how did they die and who carried them off to the animal cemetery , " we begged again . " It was the cherries , " she moaned . " I had stored them nicely in the pantry . It seems they burst their seal , and I was worried they might be sour . I threw them out by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were good , but would n't eat them if they were bad . " " How do you know the pig did n't eat the cherries , " we asked . <p> " The pig was asleep all the time , " she said . " She never even came out of her pen . The next time I looked , the cherries were gone and the geese were dead-all five of them . " She shook her head and moaned , " Ohhhhhhh .... " <p> We did n't want Grandma to feel so bad , so we did everything we could the rest of the day to make her feel good . We were the best grandchildren who ever spent the holiday in Petri . Grandma had worked so hard for so long feeding and caring for the geese . They would have been just right for a holiday dinner . The rest of the family was coming to visit , and there would have been beautiful weather and a goose in the oven . <p> It was late that night when I heard my grandmother praying for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geese . But all she prayed about that night was the geese . In her sweet Hungarian praying voice , we heard her explain to God that it was too late to raise more geese in time for the holiday . And they were such good geese . She did n't accuse Him of doing anything wrong or of letting something bad happen . She just asked Him what to do now . <p> The next morning was the beginning of a beautiful day . This day the sun shone brightly over the farmhouse and yard . I could hear horses pulling the early wagons down the dirt road just outside our yard . I even heard some geese squawking a few houses away . Usually all the village geese wandered out into the dirt roads in big groups during the day ; then they would find their way home in the evening . I had slept in the loft as usual and was the first to hear the glorious sound of Nagymama 's voice . She was singing and clapping her hands as though heaven itself had come to earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran to see what was happening . <p> There in the yard , my grandmother stood surrounded by five big geese . Grandpa was roaring with laughter . <p> " What happened ? Where did these geese come from ? " I demanded . <p> Grandpa could hardly stop his laughter long enough to tell us anything . " They came from the animal cemetery . Look at the way they walk , just like tipsy geese ! " We all looked at the geese carefully . Yes , they had had a very hard night . " Too many cherries , " Grandpa said , still snickering . " Ohhhhhhh ... the cherries were rotten and my poor babies got intoxicated , " Grandma explained . " Ohhhhhhhhh ... they must have passed out . I thought they were dead and carried them off to the cemetery . " <p> " They look terrible , but they will get better , " I said sympathetically . " Oh , yes , " Nagymama agreed , " they wo n't feel so good for a while , but they will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner they will be just right . " <p> Nagytata , Grandpa , stood with his hands propped on his hips and shook his head . My nagymama clapped her hands together and looked up to the sky and said , " It 's a lovely day for feeding the animals , but no more cherries , please . " <p> Footnote 
##1003603 Monday , Wanda Petronski was not in her seat . But not even Peggy and Madeline noticed her absence . Usually Wanda sat in the last row of Room 13 . Wanda rarely said anything . And nobody ever heard her laugh . Sometimes she twisted her mouth in a crooked smile , but that 's all . <p> Tuesday , Wanda was not in school either . Nobody noticed her absence again , except the teacher . But on Wednesday , Peggy and Maddie did notice Wanda was n't there . Peggy was the most popular girl in school . She had many pretty clothes and her auburn hair was curly . Maddie was her closest friend . <p> The reason Peggy and Maddie noticed Wanda 's absence was because Wanda made them late to school . They waited for Wanda and she had n't come . They kept thinking she 'd come any minute . Finally they had to race off without seeing her . <p> The girls reached the classroom after the doors closed . The children were reciting the Gettysburg Address , for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peggy and Maddie slipped into their seats just as the class was saying the last lines . <p> They looked across the room and noticed Wanda was not in her seat . Come to think of it , they had n't seen her yesterday . They waited for her a while but forgot about her when they reached school . They often waited for Wanda Petronski -- to have fun with her . <p> Wanda lived on Boggins Heights , and Boggins Heights was no place to live . There were a few small frame houses , and in one of these , Wanda Petronski lived with her father . <p> Wanda Petronski . Most children in Room 13 did n't have names like that . They had easy names easy , like Thomas , Smith or Allen . <p> Wanda did n't have friends . She came to school alone and went home alone . She always wore a faded blue dress that did n't hang right . She did n't have friends , but girls talked to her . They waited for her under the maple trees on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peggy would say , giving one of her friends a nudge , " tell us . How many dresses did you say you had hanging up in your closet ? " <p> " A hundred , " said Wanda . <p> " A hundred ! " exclaimed all the girls . <p> " Yeah , a hundred , all lined up , " said Wanda . Then her thin lips drew together . <p> " What are they like ? All silk , I bet . " <p> " Yeah , all silk , all colors . " <p> " Velvet too ? " <p> " Yeah , velvet too . A hundred dresses , " repeated Wanda . " All in my closet . " <p> Then they 'd let her go . Before she 'd gone very far , they could n't help bursting into shrieks and peals of laughter . <p> A hundred dresses ! Obviously the only dress Wanda had was the blue one she wore every day . So what did she say she had a hundred for ? What a story ! <p> Then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who thought up this game , and Maddie , her inseparable friend , were always the last to leave . Wanda would move up the street , finishing the walk to school alone . <p> Peggy was not really cruel . If anybody said to her , " Do n't you think that is a cruel way to treat Wanda ? " she would have been surprised . Cruel ? What did the girl want to go and say she had a hundred dresses for ? Anybody could tell that was a lie . Why did she want to lie ? And she was n't an ordinary person . Why else would she have a name like that ? Anyway , they never made her cry . <p> As for Maddie , asking Wanda every day how many dresses she had was bothering her . Maddie was poor herself . She wore hand-me-down clothes . Thank goodness , she did n't live up on Boggins Heights or have a funny name . <p> Suppose Peggy and the others started in on her next ! Of course she would have more sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not like them to begin on her . Not at all ! Oh ! She did wish Peggy would stop teasing Wanda Petronski . <p> Maddie could not work . She sharpened her pencil , letting the shavings fall in a heap on a piece of paper , and trying not to get dust on her arithmetic paper . <p> A slight frown puckered her forehead . She did n't like being late . And , also , she kept thinking about Wanda . <p> How had the hundred dresses game begun in the first place ? she asked herself . Oh , yes . She remembered . It had begun that day Cecile wore her new red dress . <p> It was a bright blue day in October , when she and Peggy were coming to school . As they turned from Oliver Street onto Maple , the sun shone straight in their eyes . Besides that , bright flashes of color came from a group of girls across the street . The girls were all shouting , each trying to talk louder than the others . Maddie and Peggy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hi , Maddie ! " they were greeted warmly . " Look at Cecile ! " <p> What they were all exclaiming about was the dress Cecile had on . It was a pretty dress , and everyone admired it . <p> It was then that Wanda had come along . Even Wanda looked pretty in this sunshine , and her pale blue dress looked like a piece of summer sky . <p> Wanda slowly approached the group of girls as a timid animal might , ready to run if anything alarmed it . Even so , Wanda 's mouth was twisted into the vaguest suggestion of a smile . <p> As Wanda joined the girls , everyone was talking . Nobody said anything to Wanda , but there she was , a part of the crowd . The girls closed in a tighter circle around Cecile , still talking at once , and Wanda was enveloped in the group . <p> Maybe she figured all she had to do was say something and she 'd be one of the girls . This would be easy because all they were talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said something . Her blue eyes shone and she looked excited like the rest of the girls . <p> " What ? " asked Peggy . For Wanda had spoken very softly . Wanda hesitated and then repeated her words firmly . <p> " I got a hundred dresses home . " <p> " A hundred dresses . A hundred ! " <p> Peggy 's voice raised itself higher and higher . <p> " Hey , kids ! " she yelled . " This girl 's got a hundred dresses . " <p> The crowd now centered curiously around Wanda and Peggy . <p> " A hundred dresses ? " they said . " Nobody could have a hundred dresses . " <p> " I have , though . " <p> " Wanda has a hundred dresses . " <p> " Where are they then ? " <p> " In my closet . " <p> " Why do n't you wear them ? " <p> Wanda was silent . Her lips drew together . Then she repeated , " A hundred of them . All lined up in my closet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Peggy . " The child has a hundred dresses , but she would n't wear them to school . Perhaps she 's worried of getting ink or chalk on them . " <p> Everybody fell to laughing at once . Wanda looked at them , pursing her lips . <p> " Oh , come on , hurry , " said Maddie . " We 'll be late . " <p> Off the girls ran , forgetting Wanda and her hundred dresses . Forgetting until the next day and the next , when Peggy would ask her about the hundred dresses . Yes , that was the way it had begun . <p> Maddie remembered her telling about a pale blue one with cerise-colored trimmings . And another that was brilliant jungle green with a red sash . " You 'd look like a Christmas tree in that , " the girls had said in pretended admiration . <p> Thinking about Wanda and her hundred dresses , Maddie began to wonder who was going to win the drawing contest . This contest consisted of designing dresses . Probably Peggy would win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , tomorrow the teacher was going to announce the winners . <p> The next day it was drizzling . Maddie and Peggy hurried to school under Peggy 's umbrella . " Do you think Miss Mason will announce the winners today ? " asked Peggy . <p> " Oh , I hope so , " said Maddie . <p> The minute they entered the classroom they gasped . There were drawings all over the room , dazzling colors and brilliant lavish designs . There must have been a hundred ! Everybody murmured admiringly . As soon as class assembled Miss Mason announced the winner . <p> " Although just one or two sketches were submitted by most , one girl actually drew one hundred designs -- all different and all beautiful . Any one of her drawings is worthy of winning the prize . Wanda Petronski is the winner of the medal . Unfortunately Wanda is not here to receive the applause due her . Let us hope she will be back tomorrow . " <p> The children burst into applause . Maddie and Peggy were the first to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look , Peg , " whispered Maddie , " there 's that blue one she told us about . " <p> " Yeah , " said Peggy , " and here 's that green one . Boy , I thought I could draw ! " <p> While the class was circling the room , the assistant from the principal 's office brought Miss Mason a note . Miss Mason read it and then said , " Attention , class . I have a letter from Wanda 's father . " <p> Everybody listened as Miss Mason read : <p> " Dear teacher : My Wanda will not come to your school anymore . Now we move away to big city . No more holier Polack . No more ask why funny name . Plenty of funny names in the big city . Yours truly , Jan Petronski . " <p> Miss Mason took her glasses off and wiped them on her soft white handkerchief . Then she put them on again . When she spoke , her voice was very low . <p> " This is a very unfortunate thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Maddie had a very sick feeling . She had not enjoyed listening to Peggy ask Wanda how many dresses she had . But she stood by silently , and that was just as bad . She helped make someone so unhappy that she had to move away . <p> If only she could tell Wanda she had n't meant to hurt her feelings . <p> Maddie had to do something . She had to find Wanda Petronski . Maybe she had not yet moved . Maybe Peggy would climb the Heights with her and they would tell Wanda she won the contest . And that they thought she was smart and the hundred dresses were beautiful . <p> When school was dismissed , Peggy said , " Hey , let 's go see if that kid left town . " Peggy had had the same idea ! Maddie glowed . Peggy was all right . <p> The two hurried up the street . " Well , at least , " said Peggy , " I never did make fun of her name . I never thought she had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought she was dumb . And gee , look how she can draw ! " <p> Maddie hoped they would be able to tell her they were sorry they picked on her . And to say how wonderful she was , and please not to move away . <p> The girls hurried as they rounded the top of the hill . " I think that 's where the Petronskis live , " said Maddie , pointing to a white house . It reminded Maddie of Wanda 's dress , shabby but clean . <p> Peggy knocked , but there was no answer . She and Maddie went around to the back and knocked . Still no answer . <p> " Well , " said Peggy , " let 's see if the door is open . " <p> They turned the knob of the front door . The little square room the door opened into was empty . <p> The Petronskis were gone . <p> On Saturday , Maddie spent the afternoon with Peggy . They were writing a letter to Wanda Petronski . They told her how pretty her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it ended up just a friendly letter . <p> They mailed the letter to Boggins Heights , writing " Please Forward " on the envelope . The minute they dropped the letter in the mail box , they felt happier . <p> The letter did not come back so maybe Wanda received it . Perhaps she was so hurt that she was not going to answer . You could not blame her . <p> Several weeks went by and no answer . Then one day the teacher showed the class a letter she received that morning . <p> She said , " Remember Wanda Petronski ? The bright artist ? Well , she has written me . I want to read her letter to you . " <p> The class listened intently . <p> " Dear Miss Mason : Please tell the girls they can keep those hundred dresses because in my new house I have a hundred new ones in my closet . I 'd like Peggy to have the drawing of the green dress with the red trim and Maddie to have the blue one . Yours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home from school Maddie and Peggy held their drawings carefully . " This shows she got our letter and this is her way of saying it 's all right . And that 's that , " Peggy said with finality . <p> Maddie felt sad because she knew she could n't ever really make things right . <p> She went home and pinned her drawing over a torn place in the wallpaper in her bedroom . Maddie sat down on the edge of her bed and looked at the drawing . She stood by and said nothing , but Wanda had been nice to her anyway . <p> She gazed a long time at the picture . Then she rubbed her eyes and studied it intently . The colors were so vivid she had scarcely noticed the face and head of the drawing . But it looked like Maddie ! Wanda had really drawn this for her . In excitement , she ran over to Peggy 's . <p> " Peg ! Let me see your picture . " <p> " What 's the matter ? " asked Peggy as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's drawing was lying on the bed . Maddie carefully lifted it up . <p> " Look ! That 's you ! " she exclaimed . And the head and face of this picture did look like the auburn-haired Peggy . <p> " What did I say ! " said Peggy . " She must have really liked us anyway . " <p> " Yes , " agreed Maddie , and she blinked away the tears that came as she thought of Wanda standing alone , looking at the group of laughing gifts after she had said , " Sure , a hundred -- all lined up ...

##1003609 Tuesdays the express train racing from Rhodesia to the Cape of Good Hope would tear through the silence of the hamlet . The engineer would sound the train whistle a mile away , its signal sending a forlorn note through the clear air of the sparsely inhabited semi-desert African landscape , and the two children would drop whatever they were doing to run out onto the red-dust road outside the hotel and watch . <p> The sun-baked countryside lay flat under the hot sky . In the distance the white pennant of smoke unfurling from the locomotive would become visible against the blue , the faint throb of wheels and pistons gaining in volume as the distance fell away . From a huddle of thatched mud huts at the edge of the hamlet a few ragged black children would emerge to wait , to watch . In the hotel kitchen the cook would look up from the vegetables she was peeling , expectant , pausing from her work until she had seen the train flash past her window . Hotel residents , hearing its approach , would become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blankness from their faces . Over at the dam-construction site the workmen would straighten up at the sound of the whistle , their hands shielding their eyes from the glare of the sun , to watch as the train wound its way over the barren terrain . Suddenly it was there , ripping the stillness , gusting coal grit into their eyes , its rush of wind flattening the girl 's dress against her thin body , thrusting locks of brown hair against her cheek , lifting the boy 's tow-yellow hair . Their heads would turn a small arc as their eyes followed the train 's fleeting passage . The black children would run alongside for a few yards with cupped palms out , yelling , " Penny penny penny ! " Sometimes coins would be tossed from the windows , sometimes an orange , a brown-paper bag of stale sandwiches , buns ; the black children would scramble to retrieve the booty . <p> Then the train would be gone . Quiet would settle back in their ears , the girl 's cotton dress hang limp again . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving a sooty , metallic taste on their tongues as it dissolved . The cook would go back to her half-peeled potato , the men to their digging ; vacancy would return to the faces of the people in the hotel rooms . <p> THE children were twins . Their mother had died , and they were sent for the winter school holidays from the city where they lived with two adult sisters and a black family retainer to their father , who ran a hotel in a remote corner of Cape Province . A thousand miles from nowhere , their father said of the place , just south of the Kalahari . The aching bareness of the region was a premonition of the encroachment of the dust , the aridity , the heat and glare-the true desert . Extending farther than the eye could see around the hamlet , the dry , baked earth revealed stony outcroppings of the continent 's substructure , lying like bones partly exposed . Scrubby brush , thornbush , humble in its need for existence , gripped the earth , breaking the undulating flatness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep wells had to be sunk to bring the precious substance up from springs that arose in the cool dark netherworld . Pumps that kept the water trickling into storage tanks were powered by wind , which kept the silver blades of windmills turning lazily against the blue . The windmills drew the eye up to the blank sky in the way the church spires of Europe draw the eye heavenward . <p> The surface of the continent here , in its inhospitality , stored none of the sun 's heat of day to warm the nights ; when the burning red disk sank behind the unbroken line of the horizon , night descended , hard , bone-chilling . Kerosene stoves would be lit to warm the public rooms , hot-water bottles offered to take the chill off beds . <p> IN the silence after the train whistle had grown faint and disappeared , the black children would wander back into their kraal , the twins return to the shade of the hotel verandah or the courtyard , where thirteen rooms were built around a giant blue gum tree , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dusty ground . There was no Room 13 . The thirteenth room had been numbered 14 , because guests declined to occupy a room with a thirteen on the door . Landing in such a forsaken place seemed sufficient misfortune without courting further ill luck . <p> The hamlet was called Doringkraal ( " Thorny Place " ) Station , though it was not a real station-merely a siding for a branch line of the railroad network that linked the vast subcontinent . <p> The silence would prevail unbroken until Thursday , when the Zambezi Express , firebox stoked red and high , would again shatter it briefly in a full-speed rush from the vineyards and whitewashed colonial mansions at the southernmost tip of Africa , where white settlers had first stepped ashore , northward to the heart of the continent , where the Victoria Falls thundered into the Zambezi River , where lions prowled in the sere grass and elephants browsed on branches wrenched off high trees . The twins and the black children would run out to see the train pass , shading their eyes from the glare until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothingness and merged with the empty landscape . <p> THE twins ' father worked hard and had little time to spare for them . They were called Sonny and Sissie , their given names all but forgotten with disuse . The girl did not enjoy having to spend school holidays at the hotel ; she had nothing to do there . Her friends were all in the city ; she was bored , lonely , imprisoned indoors by the brutal heat . She came for the reassurance of being near her father , and because she did not like to be separated from her brother . The boy loved the dry heat , the keen , clean smell of the air , the silence ; he felt the pull of the desert . <p> Transient guests at the hotel were infrequent . The bar was the real reason for its existence . A few miles distant a vast irrigation dam was being constructed , and for the white workers housed in barracklike hostels on the construction site the bar was the only means of distraction from the bleakness that surrounded them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would come in the evenings and on Saturdays , to booze heavily and steadily , play cards , get into brawls . The prevailing Calvinism , which forbade the purveying of alcohol on the Lord 's day , kept the place shut on Sundays , and the sabbath was spent recovering from drunkenness . <p> An internment camp had been built in the district to house Nazi sympathizers among the Afrikaners . All their mail was read by two censors , who were installed at the hotel for the duration of the war . The local postmaster was a permanent resident , as were the stationmaster and his wife . <p> There was a small general store owned by Mr. Levy , a wealthy landowner , whose house lay at the edge of the hamlet . From distant kraals Africans would trudge for miles to the store to buy salt , soap , maize meal , and lengths of cotton fabric , paying with coins and crumpled bills counted out from small , tightly knotted squares of cloth . <p> There was nothing else , only the desert , undulating like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> All the work at the hotel was done by a middle-aged black couple whose tin shanty lay a hundred yards behind the courtyard . The woman dusted surfaces that became layered again with fine dun powder just as soon as her rag had passed over . She made the beds , scrubbed the laundry on a washboard set in a zinc tub , cooked the hotel food : thick , salty vegetable soups , overdone roasts of mutton and beef , steamed puddings with floury custards-menus originating in the damp and gloom of provincial English boardinghouses and hotels and brought to Africa in the memories of early British settlers . The manservant cleaned , swept , scrubbed floors , kept a high shine on the red-stone floor of the verandah with paste wax , chopped wood to start the fire in the black iron coal stove that blazed in the kitchen . At dawn , while the guests still slept , he polished the shoes they had lined up outside their bedroom doors before they retired for the night . <p> The couple 's hours were long , the pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they accepted the heat of the day , the swelter of the kitchen , the small tips thrown them by drunks in the bar , the cutting cold of the night that found its way through the chinks in their tin shanty . They were good-natured , kind to the motherless children . <p> The father , a handsome reserved man not much given to conversation or displays of feeling , spoiled the girl and used the boy as an extra set of hands , legs , muscles . The girl read , wrote letters to friends in the city , knitted at a lumpy piece of knitting , listened to programs on a crackling , static-filled radio powered by a car battery , sat by the window and stared out into the desert . The boy would be set to stacking and unpacking the boxes of liquor that were trundled off the goods train that stopped infrequently at the desolate siding . He would wash and dry glasses in the bar , fetch cool beer or milk or butter or sides of meat from the cold room . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the walls dark with layered coke pebbles held in place by wire mesh , listening to the drip , drip , drip of the water fed by the windmill pump to keep the porous , carboniferous pebbles damp , so that the evaporation chilled the room . On Friday and Saturday nights , when the tavern was boisterous with drinkers , he would have to serve as an extra bartender , though the drinking laws of the country prohibited children , along with women and blacks , from entering a bar . He would be sent with trays of drinks to serve women guests , who were permitted to drink only in the hotel lounge . <p> The censors from the internment camp complained to the father that he worked the boy too hard-they and the postmaster needed Sonny for their game of rummy . But when the bar filled up , the father would call the boy to come and serve drinks . " Hy 's net a kind-laat hom speel ' n bietjie , " the postmaster would grumble . " He 's only a child-let him play a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need him . Come along , Sonny . " <p> " Ach-at least let us finish this hand , then , " one of the censors would protest . <p> The boy would lay down his cards , push back his chair , apologize to the cardplayers , and follow his father to the bar . His shoulders level with the top of the counter , he would have to raise his arms high to pour out the tots of brandy , glasses of wine . <p> Every Saturday , as soon as dark fell , a large , shaggy man , his brown hair and beard unkempt , his khaki shirt and trousers faded to a brassy green , the coarse leather of his velskoen boots caked with the dust of the miles of desert he had trudged , would push open the door of the bar , sit down at a table , and place his hat on the floor . A German who spoke not a word of English or Afrikaans , he would nod at the father , who would bring him a double brandy and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solitary drinking the German would stand up , lumber over to the small upright piano in the corner of the room , and accompany himself singing mournful lieder and rowdy drinking songs until closing time . To the patrons he was as much a feature of the tavern as the shelves of dark , gleaming liquor bottles and the smell of the kerosene stove . <p> " Where does he live ? " the boy asked his father . " Somewhere out there " -the father jerked his head toward the window- " in the desert . " " What does he do ? " <p> The father shrugged . " He 's crazy-a hermit or something . They say he lives somewhere in a hut with a kaffir woman . " At ten o'clock the hotel lights would be dimmed for a few moments to warn the patrons that the electricity generator was to be switched off in exactly fifteen minutes . Last drinks were served , drunks pushed out , tables cleared , ashtrays emptied . Outside , laughter could be heard , arguments , sometimes fistfights . Car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers headed through the dark back to the irrigation scheme . The German would bang the piano shut , rise unsteadily , and clap his stained broad-brimmed felt hat onto his head . Without a word he would stumble out , cross the road , and shamble off into the darkness . Hotel residents would hasten to wash and undress before the lights were put out . The twins would be in their beds , in the room they shared , by the time the throb of the generator was cut off and black night obliterated the hotel . <p> From the servants ' shack the red glow of the coal brazier would fall through the cracks between the sheets of corrugated tin , casting thin molten bars along the cold dark ground . Tired out , the boy would fall asleep at once , frequently dreaming that his mother , alive and well , opened the door and stepped into the room . The girl would lie awake , listening to her brother 's breathing , thinking of school , friends , clothes , the book she was reading , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knowledge-newly acquired and confirmed by the darkness-that the world was a place without safety or tenderness . Falling asleep at last , she would be awakened before dawn by the ringing of the ax as the manservant split logs into kindling to feed the cookstove , the rattle of iron as he shook last night 's cold ashes out of the grate . Warm and drowsy , she could more easily fall into a second sleep . <p> An occasional commercial traveler stayed overnight , or a family moving across country from one small , desolate town to another in hope of something better . The stationmaster 's wife , a brittle , birdlike woman , kept to her room most of the day , reading magazines , painting her nails , experimenting over the sink with different shades of hair coloring , crocheting elaborate blouses for herself in pink , magenta , violet . She would appear three times a day in the dining room for her meals , and sit upright in the lounge at night , chatting to whoever was there , sipping beer , contemplating her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very rarely she would emerge from her room in a white straw hat and go walking the few hundred yards along the dusty road to the stationmaster 's office to visit her husband . <p> THE postmaster , a great fair-haired bull of a man , silent , surly , sat alone all day in the shed that was his postal depot , drank beer all evening , slept heavily all night . Once , on a long weekend , he appeared with a woman in tow . For the entire three days they kept to his room , drinking , the woman never once emerging , he sobering up from time to time to fetch plates of sandwiches or steak and eggs , coffee , and bottles of brandy from the bar . On Tuesday morning the woman was gone , and the postmaster , bathed and combed and shaved , was behind the counter , his usual self , sparing of words and of grace . That was the year the postmaster brought that woman here , the locals used to say afterward . A MIXED goods train came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the freight cars , with faces gazing dully from the windows . Passengers seldom alighted . There was no platform , only gravel strewn on either side of the train tracks . The train would stop for ten minutes , give a toot , and chug away from Doringkraal into the barren veld , growing small and faint until it disappeared on the endless plain . <p> One day the train door opened and a woman stepped off , carrying a small suitcase . Not young , she was dark-haired , pretty , slender in a dress of pale-blue flowered cotton . She asked the stationmaster which way the hotel lay , stepped onto the red-dust road , and set off in her high-heeled shoes , while he watched the way her small rounded buttocks moved up and down under the fabric of her dress . <p> At the hotel she signed her name in the register : Mrs. Hettie Prinsloo . The servant was called to carry her luggage to her room . There was no explanation for her presence in the remote hamlet , though much speculation . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her magazines and showed her crochet patterns . In the evenings she joked and chatted with the men , who would bring their drinks out of the bar to sit with her in the lounge , and she accepted the brandies they bought for her . Most surprising to the twins , she seemed to penetrate their father 's taciturnity and reserve . They would come upon him in conversation with her in the dim stillness of the afternoon lounge . Flies droned against the windowpanes or buzzed , frantic , entrapped by the gummed flypaper that dangled from the ceiling , until , exhausted by the struggle , they gave up and expired , the desiccating corpses swaying as currents of air moved sluggishly in the room . <p> The girl , coming in and finding her father smiling and unwontedly amiable , would lean against his knee as they talked , admiring Mrs. Prinsloo 's black curls , her round , rouged cheeks , her well-shaped calves in silk stockings . " Why did you come here , Mrs. Prinsloo ? " she asked once . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out the train window , Sissie . So I decided to get off and spend a while here . " Then she and the father both laughed , their amusement perplexing the girl . " Do n't call me Mrs. Prinsloo , " she went on . " You and Sonny can call me Auntie Hettie if you want . " <p> But they continued to call her Mrs. Prinsloo . When the father made his weekly trip to Pofadderkranz , a small town fifty miles away , he had sometimes taken the twins along for the drive . Now Mrs. Prinsloo went with him instead . " It makes a nice change of scene , " she said , tying a sky-blue chiffon scarf over her curls . Once , she brought back slabs of milk chocolate for the twins ; the chocolate had melted from the heat in the car , and they had to eat it by licking it out of the silver foil wrapping . <p> Her presence remained a mystery ; none of the hotel residents or the drinkers in the bar could elicit any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only the present sustained her . The days of the school holidays moved by , one day replacing the next under the unchanging blue sky . Mrs. Prinsloo stayed on . <p> ONE morning their father told the twins that they could come with him to Pofadderkranz on his weekly trip . Mrs. Prinsloo had not yet emerged from her room , her breakfast having been sent to her on a tray . The father drove in silence . The children played word games , argued about the rules , watched the desert stream unchanging past the window as though the car stood still and a painted canvas strip spun steadily round , over and over again , with the same scene depicted on it . <p> While their father attended to his business at the bank and the suppliers of provisions , they walked along the main street , looking in shop windows , watching farmers from outlying districts loading bags of grain , cartons of canned goods , agricultural implements , onto their trucks . " Give us money for ice cream , Pa , " the girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had gazed absently at the handful of change he took from his pocket , stirring the coins with his finger , before placing the small silver three-penny bits in each child 's hand . <p> In the window of the cafe run by a Greek immigrant they saw a large red-and-yellow poster . Their tongues scooping up the ice cream rapidly melting in their cones , the twins studied the poster with interest . Beneath a picture of a powerfully built man dressed in leopard-skin trunks , his muscles bulging as a great iron chain around his chest burst apart under the force of his brute strength , was printed in large black letters THE REX IRONSTONE SHOW . " The world-famous strong man and his international company of talented performers , " they read . " Only appearance this season of the World-Famous Body-Building Show . " A list of places and dates of performances followed . <p> " Look-he 'll be at Doringkraal Station next Saturday afternoon , " the boy said to his sister . <p> " Let 's ask Pa for money for tickets , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder if he 'll let us go , " the boy said , doubtful , transfixed by the breadth of the strong man 's shoulders and the narrowness of his waist . <p> As soon as they were back in the car for the journey home , the girl blurted out , " Pa-the Rex Ironstone Show is coming to Doringkraal next Saturday . Can we go , Pa ? Can we ? Tickets are only a shilling . " <p> The father drove through the arid landscape , sunk in his own preoccupations . The girl persisted . " Can we , Pa ? Can we ? " <p> " Shillings do n't grow on trees , " the father said . " Have you got any shillings ? " <p> They shook their heads . <p> " Well-how can you go , then ? " <p> They rode the rest of the way in silence . In the night , when the twins were lying in their beds , the girl said , " I think Pa was only teasing about not letting us go to the Rex Ironstone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Do n't you ? Do n't you think he was only teasing ? " " I do n't know , " the boy said . <p> Outside , the generator 's throb silenced for the night ; the brazier in the servants ' shack burned down to gray ash . <p> AT dawn on Saturday morning the Rex Ironstone Show arrived in the hamlet . When the twins awoke , two large pantechnicons and several cars were already parked opposite the hotel on a piece of land owned by Mr. Levy . The sounds of equipment being unloaded , hammering , voices shouting instructions , gave an air of festive excitement to the freshly unfolding day . <p> In the dining room the members of the Viennese Light Classical Trio were already eating when the children came in to breakfast . The three traveled with the Rex Ironstone Show and were all refugees from the war in Europe-the violinist , an elderly , rotund man with a shock of frizzed white hair ; his wife , the cellist , equally rotund , with ginger hair and high color , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a tall , lanky , depressed-looking man , bald except for a fringe of dead black hair hanging below his collar . The violinist and his wife sweated profusely , mopping their faces with their napkins as they attacked plates of maizemeal porridge , kippers and eggs , toast and marmalade , pouring cup after cup of tea from a large brown teapot . The clarinetist read from a book propped up against a flowerless vase while he ate , never raising his eyes from the page , his fork jabbing blindly at the salt cellar , the milk jug , the tablecloth , until , encountering food , it conveyed a morsel up to his mouth . <p> Watching them , the twins were overcome by fits of uncontrollable giggles , laughing , spluttering , and choking over their food . <p> After breakfast they raced across the road to the field . Grandstands were being hefted into position by a work force of local black men . Rex Ironstone himself lumbered about , his massive form ungainly in clothes-a Goliath uneasy in huge khaki shirt and broad trousers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he harried the blacks , yelling and swearing at them in Afrikaans . " Ja , baas ; ja , baas , " they mumbled , hammering pegs into the hard ground , raising striped canvas screens backstage to make dressing rooms for the performers , laughing and making jeering remarks to one another in their own tongue about the giant of a baas . At the edge of the field a group of half-naked black children clustered , their bony rib cages furrowed above their swollen bellies . A girl no older than eight jiggled absently from time to time to quiet the fretting of an infant swaddled to her back in a strip of gray blanket . The baby 's nose ran . Flies kept settling on its face , and it moved its small wool-peppered head about in irritation . <p> The twins went all over the field , curious and excited , the tension and activity mounting as the sun reached its zenith in the burning sky , infecting them with optimism . <p> " I 'm sure Pa will let us come to the show . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that we can get our tickets early , " Sissie said . <p> They ran back across the road to the hotel . In the lobby the door to the public telephone stood wide open , a commotion of irate yelling in English and Afrikaans issuing from it . They heard a ringing clang as the phone was hurled at the wall , and a man came bursting out of the cubicle and stormed up to the reception desk , where their father was talking with Mrs. Prinsloo . A commercial traveler from Kimberley , a regular at the hotel always referred to by their father as " the Scotchman , " he had been trying all morning to get through to his wife , who was expecting a baby . " What kind of a telephone exchange is it you have in this Godforsaken hole of a place ? " he said in a broad Scots accent , his rs rolling , his face scarlet , his fists clenched in rage . " Since early this morning I 've been trying to make a simple trunk call , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection for me ! Does a body have to be half-witted in order to qualify for a job with the telephone service in these parts ? " <p> The twins , stifling their giggles , watched as their father placated the Scotchman and urged him back to the booth , where the phone dangled from its cord . Their father smiled his reluctant smile and gave them a conspiratorial wink . Mrs. Prinsloo , not smiling , walked out onto the verandah without looking at them . <p> " Pa , " Sissie said , " the show will be starting soon . Give us the money now , so that we can go and buy our tickets before lunch . " <p> " What have you done to deserve it ? " he asked , teasing . " Come on , Pa . " <p> " Run away now-do n't bother me . " He looked out the window onto the verandah where Mrs. Prinsloo was leaning against one of the upright wooden posts that supported the tin roof . " I 've got all these invoices to check through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger and riffling through a pile of papers on the desk . <p> Disconsolate , they went out and sat on the edge of the polished red-stone verandah . Mrs. Prinsloo moved away and sat down on a bench made of dried bent branches . The twins looked out at Mr. Levy 's field , watching as cars drove in from distant farmsteads and families spilled out , queuing up for tickets , filling the front rows of the grandstand , and settling down to picnics out of large baskets . <p> When the servant struck the gong for lunch , Mrs. Prinsloo stood up . " Ach-this heat is making my head ache . I 'm going to lie down in my room . " She went indoors . The father looked up from his invoices , but she went past him without speaking and through the baking courtyard to her room . <p> The dining room was already crowded with workers who had come down early from the dam to see the show- The girl ate a slice of bread and butter , declining the thick , steaming soup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guavas . The boy ate a little from each course . <p> " What 's the matter , kindjies ? Why do n't you eat ? " the black man asked , removing plates of food . <p> " We 're not hungry , " the boy told him . <p> In the lobby the phone rang , and the Scotchman could be heard arguing excitedly with the operator . The children did not smile now , or look at each other . <p> After lunch they sat on a hard horsehair sofa in the lounge , looking through outdated magazines they knew by heart . Mrs. Prinsloo came in and sat down with a piece of crochet . She took up the hook in one hand , but the work lay limp in her lap . <p> " The heat in this place is beginning to get me down , " she said . " Are n't you going to see the show , Mrs. Prinsloo ? " the boy asked . <p> She shook her head . <p> At ten minutes before two the father looked in . Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an intricacy of the pattern . <p> " I thought you two wanted to go to the show , " he said . " What are you hanging about in here for ? " <p> They waited , sitting on the hard sofa , not trusting him . <p> " You 'll be late if you do n't get a move on . " He reached into his pocket and took out two shillings . <p> They jumped up , took the money , and ran out , calling , " Thanks , Pa . " <p> The father sat down on the couch beside Mrs. Prinsloo . She stood up as if to leave , and the father caught her wrist , restraining it lightly between his finger and thumb . Above the murmur of their conversation rose the sounds of the servants clattering dishes in the kitchen , the Scotchman yelling into the phone in accented Afrikaans . Mrs. Prinsloo sat down again , the father 's fingers retaining their light hold on her wrist . <p> THE grandstand was three-quarters filled , the audience mostly male , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacant space high up , eyes fixed on the stage . <p> The Viennese Light Classical Trio-the men in black ties and shabby tailcoats , the woman in a tight-fitting long black gown-sat on small folding chairs under the hot African sun . They were well into the overture to William Tell , the music cantering away at a brisk pace across the desert . Then the clarinetist , doubling as a tympanist , beat out a rolling flourish on the kettle drum , and Rex Ironstone , in leopardskin trunks and wrestler 's boots , came striding forth from one of the canvas dressing booths and stood center stage , hands on hips , displaying his physique . <p> The audience was ready for him . They cheered , whistled , clapped . Small children gazed wide-eyed at the monstrously overdeveloped giant . He accepted their homage , each individual muscle seeming to possess a life and an identity of its own as it rippled and slid and snaked under his taut bronzed skin . His weights were already onstage . He flexed his biceps , inhaled a great volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then , trembling , sweating , groaning , proceeded to lift a series of progressively heavier dumbbells above his head and to rupture iron chains asunder . Each feat was climaxed by vigorous bursts of Die Meistersinger from the Viennese Trio . The desert air echoed with wild applause . <p> His act was followed by a magician with an Irish accent whose sleight of hand with rabbits and top hats and silk handkerchiefs seemed not to impress the crowd . Sporadic jeering and hooting broke out among the irrigation-dam workers , many of them already the worse for drink . <p> Miss Ivy Viljoen , an acrobatic artist who was more to their taste , received a standing ovation . Her sequined leotard glittered in the harsh sunlight as she tied herself in knots and peered out at the grandstand from unlikely angles and unexpected parts of her anatomy . <p> The heat was intense , the day so still that the silver blades of the windmills stood motionless against the solid blue of the sky . Side by side , high up in the grandstand , the twins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transformed for them , everything mutable now , unbounded , charged with possibility . <p> REX Ironstone emerged again , to introduce the next performer . " One of my most successful students , " he announced . " Miss Trixie van Tonder ! Miss van Tonder , after taking only one , three-month correspondence course in the Rex Ironstone Body-Building Technique , has had her whole life changed . Before enrolling in my course Trixie was a weak and sickly young woman , unable to hold a job or enjoy life . Now " -there was a roll on the kettle drum- " not only is she running the four-thousand-acre farm of her father , who has been stricken with illness , but she is also able to lift a bale of hay with one hand " ( the crowd roared its pleasure ) , " handle a team of oxen " ( whistles , cheers ) , " and only last month showed her strength by pushing an overturned tractor upright , single-handed ! " Feet stamped enthusiastically on the wooden boards of the grandstand . " Ladies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trixie van Tonder ! " <p> The trio burst into " One Fine Day " from Madam Butterfly , and from one of the canvas booths emerged Miss Trixie van Tonder , a broad , thuglike young person with the looseswinging movements of an orangutan . She was dressed in a black leotard , one of her muscular shoulders bare . Black ringlets cascaded onto her shoulders , and her small , baleful eyes were heavily mascaraed . The irrigation-dam men went wild , flung hats in the air , smashed beer bottles , whistled shrilly through their fingers . <p> She bowed gravely and shook hands with Rex Ironstone , who then retired into one of the changing booths . In a gruff basso voice , interrupted by frequent cheering , she told of her transformation from sickly weakling to strong woman , assuring the audience that the most feeble and underdeveloped of them had the potential to become as she was , simply by enrolling in the Rex Ironstone Body-Building Course , results guaranteed . She did a few warm-up exercises , accompanied by cries of encouragement mixed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the trio , who flung themselves into " The Ride of the Valkyries , " she ripped a burlap bag to shreds with her bare hands , crushed a couple of large tin cans with her fingers , and proceeded to lift weights . The crowd 's enthusiasm intensified with each feat . <p> Across the road at the hotel , the lobby and lounge were deserted . The courtyard with the rooms surrounding it contained the heat like an oven , a meager patch of shade huddling beside the trunk of the blue gum tree . Of the father and Mrs. Prinsloo no sign could be seen . The Scotchman , still waiting for his trunk call to come through , watched what he could of the show from the shade of the verandah . <p> Now Miss Trixie van Tonder announced that by special request she would sing for them-just one song . Solemn , unsmiling , she folded her arms across her chest , signaled to the trio to start up the accompaniment , and , strutting across the stage , began to sing " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , legs planted firmly apart , held up her arms , and flexed her biceps . <p> " I 'm Popeye the Sailor Man . <p> I 'm strong to the finish , <p> ' Cause I eats me spinach- " <p> At that moment a guy rope securing one of the changing booths snapped . The canvas screen fluttered wildly and came down , collapsing onto the stage , revealing Miss Ivy Viljoen , the acrobatic artist , clad only in a short white singlet that ended just above her navel . Close to her Rex Ironstone towered in his leopard-skin trunks . Miss Ivy Viljoen looked up in astonishment at the massed faces watching her , looked at Rex Ironstone , looked around like a trapped , desperate creature , and , seeing only the bare expanse of the flat desert , gave vent to a series of penetrating screams that ripped through the trio 's music and Trixie van Tonder 's song . Screeching lustily , she tugged at the hem of her singlet , ineffectually trying to remedy its scantiness . Rex Ironstone , befuddled , stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delight the audience bellowed their unbridled excitement like a herd of wild beasts massed under the afternoon sun . Onstage Miss Trixie van Tonder glanced over her shoulder . Perceiving the nature of the crisis , she signaled to the trio for more volume . Valiantly she strutted across the stage , proclaiming with all the power and resonance of her broad chest that she was Popeye the Sailor Man . <p> At the hotel the Scotchman had just got through to his wife , whose voice was obliterated by the surging roar from the crowd across the road . Cursing , he dropped the phone , leaving it to bang and rattle in his wife 's ear , and stormed out onto the verandah , where the servants were trying to make out what the clamor was about . His face suffused with rage , he jumped up and down , shaking his fist at the empty sky and calling damnation down on " all those Boer bastards . " The servants grinned broadly , enjoying the lunacy of the whites . <p> Frantic , the Viennese Trio played on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drowned out by the cheering , the thumping , the ribald laughter . <p> The twins , by now helpless with mirth , were doubled over , so that the boy had to grab hold of his sister 's dress to prevent her from slipping and falling into the space beneath the grandstand . <p> Gallantly the violinist tore off his tailcoat and tossed it to Rex Ironstone , who gazed stupidly at it for a few moments before flinging it around the hysterical , half-naked girl . Someone yelled out an order , and a gang of black men came forward to pull up the ropes ; the concealing screen was raised once again , cutting the pair off from view . <p> The irrigation men booed . The trio started up a set of Strauss waltzes , which tinkled thinly , barely audible against the roar that continued unabated from the audience . Miss Trixie van Tonder retreated . The disorder faded slowly , the remainder of the show feeble entertainment after such a peak . But the euphoria of the crowd was not affected . People went back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another with shouts of laughter and animated miming . <p> In the evening , in the lounge , the irrigation men kept plying Mrs. Prinsloo with brandies . " Where were you , Mrs. Prinsloo ? " they asked . " You should have been there-you missed the greatest show on earth . " From the bar coarse jokes and bawdy stories sent gusts of laughter swelling out . " Ach-I had a bit of a headache this afternoon , but it 's better now , " she said , touching her dark curls with the palm of her hand , turning her head to glance across the lounge into the bar at the father busy behind the counter , accepting a brandy from the chief engineer , another from one of the censors . <p> There was a great thirst in the hotel all evening . The German played noisy drinking songs , his baritone voice increasing in volume with his drunkenness . The boy worked alongside his father , serving drinks until closing time . <p> ALL day Sunday , Mrs. Prinsloo remained in her room . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was reading beside the open window of her room , saw Mrs. Prinsloo crossing the courtyard with a suitcase in her hand . The boy , on his way to the cold room to fetch a can of milk , saw her walking along the red-dust road toward the station . In her high-heeled white shoes , her paleblue flowered dress , she walked straight ahead , not turning to wave or to look back . At the station she sat down on a wooden bench outside the office shed , her silk-stockinged calves pressed neatly together , her shoes side by side on the gravel . The stationmaster , curious , came out to talk to her . <p> " Where is Mrs. Prinsloo going today ? " he asked . " Where do you want a ticket to ? " <p> " I 've got my ticket right here , " she said , patting her white-straw handbag and staring out across the tracks , ignoring him , so that he went back into his small office . <p> When the mixed goods train pulled in , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the locomotive took her away in the direction it had been heading when she had first alighted . The stationmaster stood watching until the train was out of sight . Then he took off his cap and dabbed the damp red crease on his forehead with a handkerchief before going back into his shed . <p> That was the year Mrs. Prinsloo was here , the locals would say afterward . <p> The blades of the windmill barely moved . The boy lugged the cool , dewy milk can across the yard toward the kitchen . She had asked them to call her Auntie Hettie , he recalled . A few days before , he had risen early to go and inspect some kittens the cat had given birth to under the wooden floor of the verandah that lined the courtyard . The first daylight was still pale in the sky over the desert . He had come upon Mrs. Prinsloo walking along the verandah toward her room . She was wearing a dressing gown of shiny apple-green ; it cast up onto her face an unpleasant reflection that made her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the daytime . It was so early that the shoes the manservant had taken away to polish had not yet been replaced outside the guests ' rooms . She had smiled at him , touching his shoulder . " Everyone nice and warm in their beds except for Sonny and Auntie Hettie ? " she had murmured . " Where are you off to at the crack of dawn ? " He had not answered , slipping his shoulder from under her hand and jumping down off the verandah to crouch and peer into the dawn-slatted darkness beneath the floorboards where the mother cat lay suckling her scrawny kittens . He heard Mrs. Prinsloo 's high-heeled backless slippers clipclopping away back to her room , her door softly closing . <p> He put the milk can down to rest his arms for a moment . She had wanted them to call her Auntie Hettie , but they always called her Mrs. Prinsloo ; and now she was gone . In the quiet after the train had left , the slow drip , drip , drip of water in the cooler was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 
##1003610 I 'm going skating , Dad ! I 'll be back later , " Josie called . She slung her beatup hockey skates over her shoulder and headed for the ice rink . <p> Josie 's new home was in Minnesota , where winters are cold and everyone dresses in long underwear , double sweaters , wool stocking caps , and mitten liners to keep warm . Josie loved the snow and cold weather . It was just like her last home in North Dakota . <p> The notice pinned to the bulletin board at school had said , " SIGN UP FOR NEW FOURTH GRADE HOCKEY LEAGUE-Mason Park Ice Rink , Sunday , 2 PM . " Josie was right on time . <p> The temperature was close to zero , and the strong wind made it seem even colder . All the kids were so bundled up you could n't tell whether they were children or aliens . " Let 's see your stuff . Line up at this end of the rink ! " called Coach Stokes . " Short kids in front . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line . " Two at a time , skate to the end and back , as well and as fast as you can . " <p> Josie took off , skating hard , and was halfway back to the start before her partner had reached the other end . Coach Stokes said , " Good job , " and asked her name . <p> She answered , " Jo Turner . <p> The next day , four teams were posted on the board , and the name Joe Turner was listed on the Bears roster . Josie grinned . Suddenly , she was jostled from behind . <p> " Who 's Joe Turner ? " asked a boy . " Do you know him , Charlie ? " <p> " Nope , " answered Charlie , " he must be new . Guess we 'll have to wait and see . " <p> That night , Josie told her parents that she had made the hockey team . " Is n't that a pretty rough game for girls ? " her father asked . <p> " Maybe , " said Josie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wear my helmet and face shield . Anyhow , I played a lot of hockey when we lived in Fargo , remember ? " She hesitated . " You do n't mind , do you ? " <p> Mr. Turner sighed . " If hockey is what you want to do , then I suppose your mom and I can get used to the idea . " <p> Josie 's mother nodded her head in agreement , then smiled and added , " You just be careful out there , OK ? " <p> The next day at school , Josie could n't wait for the first team practice . As she finished her lunch in the cafeteria , she began to daydream . Josie Turner , hockey star . She 's fast , and she 's good . That 's how Josie thought about herself . She 'd been skating a long time , and she did n't see any reason why she could n't be the best player on the hockey team . <p> After school , Josie hurried toward the park . It would n't be long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After several minutes of stretching and skating to warm up , a practice game began between the Bears and the Lions . Josie , by far the best skater , was chosen for right wing . <p> " Face off ! " Coach Stokes dropped the puck in the circle on one end of the ice , and the Bear 's center passed it to Josie . She stopped , skated backward for a second to change direction , and then charged up the rink , skate blades flashing , flipping the puck from one side of her stick to the other to keep it away from the Lions ' defense . In a few seconds , she had whipped the puck into the goal , even though the Lion 's goalie had flopped full-length on the ice to stop it . <p> " Goal ! " shouted the team , gathering around Josie with their sticks raised in tribute . Josie beamed behind her face shield . <p> Before practice was over , Josie had scored four goals with no assistance . As she was changing her skates to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thought Josie . He probably found out I 'm a girl and wo n't let me play anymore . <p> " You 're a good skater , Turner , " he said . " Think about this , though : Sometimes being the best is n't what counts . See you tomorrow . " <p> Josie was puzzled . What did he mean ? <p> The next day , she overheard two boys from the team talking after school . <p> " Turner 's pretty good , all right , " said one . " But I hope Coach benches him . " <p> " Yeah . I could n't wait to get out of there last night . What a showoff ! Never passed once to the other wing . He does n't know what the word ' team ' means . " <p> Josie stopped . She felt sick to her stomach . Showoff ! She was the one who had made all the points ! Had n't she done her best ? What did they want , anyway ? They were just jealous ! <p> But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Josie Turner starhah ! Josie Turner , showoff ? Being a girl was n't the problem . She had n't passed the puck even once to anyone . It did seem as though she did n't know what ' team ' meant . <p> But that did n't mean she could n't learn . Coach Stokes was right . Being the best was n't what counted . Helping make the team the best was what mattered most . Maybe " Joe " Turner was a showoff , but not Josie . Things would be different at today 's practice . She would start by telling Coach Stokes and the other players her real name . Josie hurried home to get her skates and equipment . <p> She 'd show those Bears she could change . And whether they won or lost , they 'd do it together-as a team . <p> 
##1003612 At forty-two , I was in my last blaze of attraction . She was the girl I could never have . She was all the power , every minute of lost lechery in my life , a dream in a black wind . <p> I WAS IN NORTH DAKOTA AROUND THE SAC BASE in March . The wind blew hard across the beet fields and the tarmac , wherever it was . I had done my duty in Grand Forks and we talked in a bar . She and her girlfriend were both in cowboy boots . The woman I was interested in had very excellent calves . Her face was high cheekboned with huge eyes like china marbles . Her forehead was touched around by brown bangs that made my stomach ache . She was a Florida beauty , Tallahassee , just a slight quarter inch heavy with winter flesh , that 's all , a slight quarter inch . I told her she was the one who broke my heart in high school and made me cry on my pillow . She was the type . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved Little Anthony because he could gasp so good , he wrung it all . Later , when I was alone with her , she said she was n't really that type . She was a simple southern girl , but her father was Satan . We were in those couples " apartments near the SAC base . The apartment was similar to rooms I had down south when I was first a bachelor , divorced . But they were even smaller and poorer , with a feeling of transience , little attempt at decoration . My home woman and I had become , I think , old friends more kindly than passionate . In fact , she was still married although long separated . We had hung together in a vast common loneliness almost like love . I liked to see her onstage in a gown , playing her flute in the orchestra very well . She had a doctorate from Boston University , which I understand is something . She had lent me some money in a humiliating emergency , and now in Grand Forks I had a check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt square , decent , and very American all of a sudden , as when you leave a gym with your hair seriously combed , wet , and walk into the cool evening . The earth is glad to see you . The girl from Tallahassee was only twenty-four . I was forty-two . She showed me album after album of B-52 's in the air and on the ground . Her husband had wanted to be a fighter pilot but had not come up to the mark when he left Colorado Springs , the Academy . I did n't mean to be ugly but I thought this was boring , the sky and the bombers , the ground and the bombers , the squad and the bombers . I might have said this . But she thought they were beautiful and told me so again and again . She was divorcing her husband , who was in the air now , but she thought the B-s2 's were exquisite . She wanted something beautiful in her life , these pictures , and I should not have commented at all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have him either . After the tour through the photos I told her I ought to go back . This is not turning out like I wanted it to , she said . Well , this is your home , your married home . I could n't possibly do anything here , do n't you understand ? Their married bed , and besides the husband might come in from an aborted mission . She could understand that , could n't she ? I could n't have her here . But-looking back-maybe her point was to have it here , right here . Do n't be fast , be slow , she insisted . Right in the middle of the B-52 pictures . However , we drove in her car back to the motel . Crying cold black wind outside , all over Dakota . I knew it would be like this , I could imagine , she said when we were in my room . She was downcast . I felt sorry for her . My clothes were strewn around . I did n't care for the look , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town . I wanted her in an almost crippling way now . It seemed more urgent with the black wind out there . Do n't be fast , please . Just do n't be fast , all right ? she asked me . You have other experiences ? No , only with my husband , Nicholas . Now you . By this time I was flooded with gratitude . I was little but a token offered in her satisfaction . I did not quite understand this . I did not want to be greedy . Her face all this while was never ironic , always sincere . She had set about this evening with conviction . I could hardly believe it , but we were becoming friends , and I found this very arousing . I 'm a little old for you , I guess . No . What , forty-five ? Only forty-two . She thought I was even older and it seemed not to matter in the least . I may have been in my last blaze of attraction , whatever it was . But I could hardly believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nicholas , she said , not Nick . Lumbering around the sky , obsolete . In my memory , she was at school and in airports , peeling me with her eyes , just a few seconds , then turning and gone on her belly-dropping legs , off to better zones . She was the girls I could never have , in one . Then , too , I was having the Air Force and all the frigid black wind of the Dakota night , all that black wind between the places you have left behind that do n't want you anymore . All over America , from shore to shore , such lovely women as this marry too soon because somebody wants them too much . They are wanted so much they ca n't deny the hunger . The loves are too hungry and quick , the men fall on them and ravish them and use up the love almost instantly . They must eat every part . Then nothing is left , only two husks with their manners , and they are just sitting there together glum and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word to say , not a drop left to give . Nature is through with them for a long while , and they begin friction over nothing , except that each feels cheated , always cheated , cheated every minute . Somebody once told me , as a thought in consolation , when you see a beautiful woman , always remember : Somebody is tired of her . Like most advice this is probably true and absolutely useless except to the wise dead . The dead sit around us in their great hats , nude , yammering away nevertheless . I have felt of consequence to the universe only while drunk or at the moment of orgasm . These are lies , too , I know , but good ones , an inkling . Maybe next for me is prayer , but with her I was praying only not to be too fast . She had drunk three wines at her apartment while going through the photos , I nothing for a long while . Now she was lying naked on the bed , heavy breasts with dark exuberant paps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her pixie-cut hair with her high cheekbones , cheerful even though we were not lying on the B-52 photos . I was thinking of all that black wind outside the motel window , with her lying in the wind , only her . I saw nothing else in the room , just her and black rushing air around her . It was wonderful , this picture , but with an edge of terror , too , an image come alive out of regular life . The wind was screaming and her husband 's big plane , the size of a football field , was screaming through and breaking up . When I was with her I did not have her so much as melt twice inside . My word , I became a woman in her , is what it felt like . All the excitement , the hard passion from her place to here-I was sighing as if penetrated and then wrung out . Never in my life before , nothing like this . I would tell only you this , pal . I have nothing to boast about , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was hardly any pride . She was all the power , every minute of lost lechery in my life , a sucking dream in a black wind . But when she left the room , she still smiled as if she were my friend , everything was lovely . I felt unsatisfying , my spine was vapor . She had admired my body , but I was the chew toy of a dog , pal , a sad man . I had wanted too much , I think , waited too long . I had dragged her back to the motel . This was wrong . So was her apartment wrong . There was no good place , there was no right place for us . In the airplane home to Memphis , I tried to raise myself , have my esteem back . For a few minutes , I would recall her beauty and then boast inside , but this went away fast . Then I tried to attach a profound narrative to myself . My uncle , a laughing , athletic monument of a man , had mysteriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa . For years , my mother waited for news of her brother . In my infant memory I recalled her crying for him , did n't I ? His widow was a Delta beauty who remarried an important man , maybe a college president . I would see the two of them pictured in the paper . She stayed fine looking for at least thirty years . I admit to strange family thoughts about her . At fifteen , I imagined that one day she would call me up and have me over to show me the ropes , in honor of my uncle 's memory . All this was fitting for his nephew , perhaps even decreed in the Old Testament . They were twenty-three when my uncle disappeared . The woman of Grand Forks was twenty-four . She acted as if all this were inevitable . Witness our easy , instant friendship . Said I must see the bombers , must see how beautiful they were . We would have toiled in the photographs of the bombers . This was a profound narrative . But it would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a part of weeping history but the ghosts in this thing would not line up . Every now and then I would catch myself in a gasp , even a sob . Something was overcoming me , a kind of weak shame . LIFE WENT ON WITH MY WOMAN BACK HOME , but not for long . She left teaching at the college for banking , which was the profession of her father , a grim man in a characterless brick town on a hill in east Texas . I went around town dopey . The words fill me , fill me came to my lips constantly without my will . This would have been frightening but I was not that alert . I saw her play flute with the Tupelo Symphony a last time when an old man-once a master , I guess-was featured at the piano in a Gershwin concert . Either my ears had gone totally out or the man was simply possessed and awful . He thrashed on the keys way too loud and without sense . The audience sat there as if everything were sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man in tails was awful ? He might not even be the musician they invited . He might be someone deranged , an understudy who had killed the master and was now mocking him . Was I the only one appalled ? I kept listening , then I suddenly saw him naked in a tall hat . A nude , hatted monster , banging down with closed fists . Nobody around me reacted , of course . It was a sorry thing , and again , I would have been frightened , but I was dull as if doped . Finally , I could not stand this feeling anymore and went on a bender , after a year without a drink . I dragged the woman away from her commencement duties and took her to a reservoir in the northeastern corner of the state , near Tombigbee . I imagined the woodsy rocks and bluffs with a cold stream down the middle . We never found this , a place I thought very necessary , very much an emergency . The cool , wet rocks and mountain laurel with fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living off the land , a rebaptism of our selves . My fishing rods lay helter-skelter in the back of the car . But there was no proper place , then the moment was gone , and I was just a fool . We stayed in a motel with thin pseudowood walls owned by Pakistanis , the poor woman exhausted , her last loyalty expired . I could n't sleep well , and when I did I dreamed a number of the tall naked dead in extravagant hats , standing about like cattle . Within the month , the woman got an abortion as I waited in the car . It was early on . I think I cared more than she did . She had never had children and did n't want any . Then , out in Texas while she worked in her father 's bank beginning her new future , she met a blond man of new interest . I wrote to her but she did n't write back . I smelled something wrong and went on another bender , using every room in my house , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was intent on finding the safe and happy mix . No sick loonies this time , surely not . In the midst of this , the girl in North Dakota called and said her divorce from Nicholas was accomplished . She was headed back south and would drop by on her way to Florida . This was good , I was happy . There may be something serious here . I smiled in my mansion under the oaks , my dogs racing around the yard beneath the giant magnolia . Christ , I was baronial , you could n't stop me , man of many parts , hear old son ? When she came in the house , I was in a Confederate cavalry hat . I have no clear idea why , except I had also become a pilot . I could not refuse the conviction I was a fighter pilot . The hat gave me a certain authority , I felt . The passion of my race ran high in me . I talked in this vein while she sat and watched . She had lost weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into her black eyes , unconstrained , possessed . She seemed charmed and amazed . My powers wanted out of me . I could not hold them back . I had a long drink in the kitchen , staring out at my rented orchard . The future looked bright now with missy in the house . Yes , there would be great carrying on : When I returned she was gone . My nephew walked through . Who was that ? That was the best-looking woman I 've seen in my life . Now she 's just up and gone . Did n't even get her name . Old son , you fool . Do n't you understand she 'll be back ? She has no choice , I told him . I got a letter from her in Florida . Who are you ? she began . It could n't have occurred to me then , and did n't for another year , that I must have been , in my cavalry hat , a lunatic older version of the very man she had left behind in the Air Force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being a pilot . I woke up in the mode . Then the other collapse of that summer . A butchy wife and her namby husband , lawyers , bought the rented estate right out from under me . I had to pile my belongings into a two-story hovel next to a plowed field , an instant reversal from baron to sharecropper . My nephew had to drag me out of a bar where I was attempting to buy a coed with a roll of hundreds . My ex-woman was driving around town with her new smiling blond Texas boyfriend . She had changed the locks of her doors . I lost my driver 's license . I went broke . I could not eat , I went to the doc for depression . I was a wraith . Once , after some business in San Diego , as a passenger from the Memphis airport to home , I was arrested for drunken riding . I have a clear memory of the dream I had those few hours in jail . The naked dead , all in hats and a foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They said nothing . But they were mute with decision , letting their height speak . The woman from Tallahassee wrote about her affairs . Living near her father , who was Satan . Becoming adjusted to freedom . She was easy and friendly as if nothing had happened . However , I thought I detected a patronizing tone . She took me for a common fool , I decided . I drove to the home of my ex-woman . When she came out in the yard I promised her that in the future evil would come upon her . Or perhaps we could get married , I added . At the end of a bender , I have , like thousands of others , been stricken with righteousness . I wanted to have discussions with the naked dead but I could not dream them back . At the gate of an Air Force base near Columbus , Mississippi , I was thrown out by SPs after certain demonstrations . I claimed to have friends on the base , imperative that they see me . I drove following a contrail in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car dropping money , and was mugged before I could let out I was in the secret ground Air Force they had better stand wide for . The mugging did not make much of an impression on me . Unlike other drunks , I remember almost everything . Only the humiliation is left out , until later it leaps and is unbearable . I turned toward Florida , seeking Tyndall air base beyond Panama City . I would have a chat with the pals there who did n't know me yet , perhaps even her ex-husband down on a mission , then on to Tallahassee , where I would explain to the woman I was not a fool . No , I was in control , in vast control . But first I took a turn into Magnolia Springs on the eastern shore of Mobile Bay , where an old student of mine lived . We talked awhile . His parents were in the back , visiting , but he did not want me to meet them . Then he asked me to go , please . So I took my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me the world was certainly turning rude here lately , a lamentable sign of the times , those times you read about . Oh , I was high into my righteousness , and just out near some swamp and palmettos I went way off into it and attempted to set fire to my car , which would not fly and was really hot on my feet . I threw matches into it , a " 73 MG convertible . Then somebody stopped my arm . He put out the little rug fire I 'd started . He was the son of a strange nearby family who fed me for three days . I could not decide whether they were white or colored . They did n't pay much attention to me and did not speak much , but I thought I caught a foreign brogue , not Creole , when they did . They ate rice and collards . This brought my health back in little angry fragments . One morning I was suddenly very sober , just very frail . They did n't mind how much I ate because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight . Then my old student came back and told me he was taking me home . I never gave them the car but I gave them the keys and was ashamed to return a week later . My student took a look around my cottage , then took a U-turn back . I still did not understand I had been gently but seriously kicked out of his county , 350 miles far . My old girlfriend married the Texan . In the fall , I got a call from my nephew , who had heard from a musician that she was killed in a robbery of her bank in Jacksonville , Florida . Killed by crack people . She was no doubt in her smart executive suit , all bright and cheerful . New leaf , new man . She was not good with people , she once told me . Maybe a bit of a snob . I understand the new breed of crack killer is much concerned with respect . Something in her eyes , maybe . Maybe nothing at all , she was white and too lovely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the dour banker on that hill in the east Texas town , her tiny , thin mother . One of their daughters was a lesbian psychiatrist and the other was now dead from banking . He hustled peas in the Depression and now he was in modern life , on the hill there with the wind blowing the last of his hair . Nevertheless , it is said we are predators , eyes forward , and we go on toward the hunt as if nobody had eaten it all before us . As if just around the corner is the really fine feed , the really true woman , the world that will call us son . Somebody is missing to our left , but we only sniff deeper , it must be there , there . I was doing this in the aisle of a small local grocery when I turned a row and was shocked chilly , down to the bones of my hands , nearly crippled from a swat of cold nerves into my thighs and scalp . It was a very tall man all naked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray country face I was certain I knew , a man confined somewhere too long . The crown of the hat was above the top shelf of cans . He was turning my way to look but I did not want him to look at me . Then I noticed he was in a bleached pink set of long underwear , not naked , but the possibility was so close it was jolting . He opened his mouth . I ran away with my hands and groceries in my ears , with his lips twisting up there over me . I went out in the street with the groceries still in my hands . Nobody called me back . I was well home before I was aware I had them , still locked in my fingers . I had no excuse for running out with them , for running away , nothing manly anyway . My act could not be explained . I was ill and ashamed , and jerking with breaths . Next day I got a letter from the woman-now twentyfive-in Tallahassee . My hands still shook a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I did n't want to dream . She wrote that things were not going very well . She lived with her mother , but Satan , her father , lived close by . Not going well . Too close , this man . As if he could move away but not very far . It felt like forever . It hurt to discuss certain things . She asked me to forgive her . She had visited me with her winter pounds shed and with a dark suntan so as to hurt me , in her vanity . To make my mouth water . But yet I was her friend and this could no longer go unconfessed . She had wanted to change and ruin me for a while , with her beauty . It was an unfortunate trait . Her father had accused her of it all her life , but only now that she was truly adult could she admit she enjoyed inflicting pain this way , always had . Her mother , a beauty , was fast losing her looks and was always in a state , afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother spent the days simply keeping a watch on each other . They had begun going to church together . Even there , they knew the great Satan was in one of the cars in the parking lot , watching them . You must never write about me , she wrote . You think I am special but I am not . I am to be forgotten , do you understand . We have had a bad house , wherever I am is a bad room . A week later , I won an award from the governor . My old parents were there , glowing in the mansion . I was in a suit , now a goodly time healthy , but in my short acceptance speech I was conscious of sneering , ironic people somewhere in the crowd . When I looked at the rear rank of those standing , I did see three hats way above the rest and flashes of beige skin . I may have broken all forms for modesty , unwilled actually , but from a diminished heart , and held my work in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ink and flung against a tombstone . Through all this , too , I confess I was coming on to the governor 's wife-helplessly , God-and finished in a burst of meekness coupled with hideous , inappropriate lust . I could hear the laughter and was led away . I was looking at the plaque and stroking myself a couple days later as the phone rang . A voice I could not remember began . At once I could feel the black wind of North Dakota between us on the lines . She was a friend of the Florida girl . I had not seen her since I chatted with them at that bar near the Minnesota line . She was clear for a while but then started sobbing and stalling . Her friend . Our friend . You were kind to her , she said . Always she mentioned your kindness . What ? In Tallahassee , the father had run her over in her own living room and killed her . The car came in through the bay window and crushed her as she sat on the couch in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swimsuit , was broken up badly but would survive . Abruptly after the collision , the father , still in the driver 's seat , put a pistol to his ear and destroyed himself . The women were having lunch after sunning . He must have known all their moves . You are a good person , the woman said-a scrap of memory through the black air of days and days ago-and I had to tell a good person . Somebody who knew her . I am not a good person , I told her . This is too awful . Do you believe in God ? Foxhole Christian . When all else is lost . Nothing else was said and she hung up . I was suddenly something fresh to her , a way I did not know . Then she was destroyed by a monster I had never believed in , who was true . My pity was so confused I could not accept I was even worthy of having it , for weeks . Or worthy of her , or my former girlfriend . IT IS TRUE NOW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter of a World War II pilot named Angel ) , whenever a flute plays I have the woman sweet in my ears and think of our laughter . Whenever I see a headline beauty I brag quietly : Come on , I had a better , with a sad smile , I 'd imagine , that fine appreciation of ourselves when we have bittersweetness right on time . I have not had that many women , is the truth , and this , pal , I know seems crammed with serial romance and grief , but I 'm not quite through , and you will understand me at last as more that poor man on the east Texas hill with the wind in his last hairs , too thick in modern life , too thick in dream , too sad for years now . Maybe the girl in North Dakota mistook my sadness for kindness ; defeat for gentleness . I look at an old photograph of myself at eight when I was just a boy and his dog under a cowboy hat . I was looking at the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the shade of my tall Hoot Gibson . Now I understand I have been witness to the worst fifty years in the history of the world . A tragedy that might make Caligula weep in commiseration . And I have had , you know , a relatively pampered life , although you see me puffing away on my smoke like a leathered vet , a tough cookie . I used to be a considerable tennis player . So in my health I took it up again and got the game back quickly . I just had a tough time giving a damn about the score . Once I was playing with a friend and noticed a very tall , pale woman through the fence on another court . She had her back to me . I saw she struck the ball with authority and grace . I wanted her within seconds of seeing her . I needed her . I had never had a tall woman , blond , and I was already in my mind rocking with her in great abandon like a dying cannibal . The nourishment would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played well . We sat down exhausted in that fine chill of southern twilight that heaven might be . I looked to my right and somehow , in the flesh , the tall , pale woman was sitting between us . You never see that kind of European paleness in women on a southern tennis court . I was amazed at her musculature , like strands of soft wire . Then I saw the hat . She had been wearing a big unusual hat that must have given her seven feet in height . She was looking toward my friend . I had never seen her face . When she turned I looked away and in great fear I stared through the woods . I wanted her more than ever but I would not see her face . I heard her voice , though , just the once up close . I believe I 've got something you want . I grabbed my bag and got in my car and was almost home before I remembered my friend had no ride home , a long way . But I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , however . Man , the woman was fast on you . What the devil , did you see all of her , fool ? I 'm much the better-looking , but all she gave me was a pouting ride home . Who is she ? Somebody 's relative . Ca n't remember . Too busy stealing looks . That 's quite a drink of water , long and cool , old son . You never knew her ? Never set eyes on her . You 're an uncommon fool . And sober . She has been around town now for a couple of years . I see parts of her here and there , but I walk or drive right away . I do n't intend to see her face because I know I 've already seen it . When we touch , one of us will die and be in the other 's dreams . I am not insane . My affairs are composed in vicious sobriety . I did not see my tennis partner either for several months . Then he called at the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , other places . The tall one was back on the courts the other day . I swear , fool , she 's like something from the heart of winter in a foreign land . Some old story full of wolves where you 'd stumble into a woman lying in the woods . I 'm going to use a word . Alabaster . I swallowed . You mean living or dead ? I 'm not sure , mister . Wolves . I wonder , when she dies , likely by violence , will she be named like the lesser creatures in that story ? Certain people believe all are given names when we die , not at birth . The creature goes to heaven very baffled . My God , what was all that about ? it asks . God says : Well , you were a wolf . I see , says the wolf . I wonder will it be that simple for her , or for me . Ft 
##1003614 In that fall of 1910 the days came and the days went and they blurred into one as we worked in a daze from lack of sleep . Traffic in the Pennsylvania coal fields was unusually heavy , and it would be for another month as the railroad moved as much coal as possible before winter . It seemed if you were in engine service you could n't sleep more than ten minutes before the boy banged in to shake and cuss you awake . If you worked as a train hand you 'd swear your name was chalked-in solid across the extra board . <p> It was during this time that Hal Walker got himself fired for failing to make a brake test before taking a train down Walnut Hill grade . He 'd been on the railroad 30 years , but it was a long-awaited and welcome event because almost every trainman disliked him , and secondly , it was a diversion from the grind for all of us . Hal was a conductor blessed with the disposition of a rhinoceros : He was bellicose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it made your day longer just trying . <p> Some of the few off-duty train hands were gathered that night at the brotherhood hall discussing the proceedings leading to his dismissal , and the general feeling was the company had legitimate grounds . " Could n't anybody stand to work with him , anyway , " said a brakeman who 'd often been on Walker 's crew . <p> " He got what he deserved , " said another . " Yeah , " said a short brakeman with a blackbearded face , " but did he really deserve it ? " <p> This surprised me , and I looked at Shorty , guessing what might be on his mind . " Did he deserve to get fired ' cause nobody liked him ? " <p> " Course not , Shorty . They let him go because he did n't test his brakes before going down Walnut Mountain grade . You know that . " Shorty went on , " Did he do his job the last 30 years ? Did he ever cause anybody on his crew to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luck to be on Walker 's crew more than once and agreed he was a good conductor if you were talking about getting the work done , but not if you were talking about the ticklish art of human relations . <p> " There was no love lost between us , but I hope they 'll give me another chance if I ever break the rule book that bad , " said Shorty , expectorating on the stove . " That other 30 years he worked here ought to count for something . " Nobody said anything , but you could tell some felt the same way . The topic was changed , and gradually the men drifted off to the pool table or a card game . " Well , you sure did pull the fire on this bunch , " I said to Shorty . <p> " I guess I did , Red , but this whole business does n't lay right with me . We both know it was n't his fault . " A man at the pool table looked up and said : " Then whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walnut Hill and him not testing his brakes right before it happened ? And do n't forget , Shorty , that you and the whole crew almost booked off permanent on account of it . " " That 's right , we did , " said Shorty , " but that does n't change anything . He 's still not to blame for our train getting away from us . There 's something else happened that throws a different slant on it . " <p> Some of the men gathered around again . " What 're ya talkin ' about , Shorty ? " Shorty cut off a plug of Brown 's Mule and loaded his bean hopper : <p> " Here 's what happened that day , " he said . " We went in for no. 3 at the top of the hill and waited for her to come on so we could follow her down . We inspected our train and found no defects and the brakes was in good order . When we went in the office I saw the outside thermometer was right on 44 degrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have froze while we stopped . It was 20 minutes before no. 3 was due , so Red and me decided we 'd check the empty boxcars and collect from the riders . After we counted our fares , Red said , If we ca n't beat this , it may be time to pack our lingerie and move on to another road . ' Do n't you remember , Red ? " " Yeah , That 's just what I said . " " Remember two of them tried to give us a hard time ? Said they was gon na throw us off our own train , and we had to use our brake clubs to persuade them different ? " " That 's right . " <p> " After that , I went out front to wait for no. 3 . After it went by , I opened the switch to let us on the main and gave Kelly , who was hogger that day , the high sign . He sat there not moving . I waved him a come-forward again , but still he did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took up the story from there . " Right , Shorty . I watched you makin ' them signals and when Kelly did n't move , I figured he could n't see you . I walked over to the kettle to see what was the delay , and found Kelly asleep at the throttle . He 'd dozed off while waitin ' for the varnish . Wake up Kelly , no. 3 just went by , ' I told him . He kind of jumped awake when I shook his shoulder and looked like he did n't know where he was . know bells was ringin ' in his head . " Several of the men nodded . They all knew the feeling of trying to catch a nap and being awakened suddenly . <p> " Kelly shook his head and told me , Lord , Red , I could sleep till Judgment Day - I doubled over last night on a westbound . If I 'm not careful I 'll be in the same fix I was in last month - I was ballin ' the jack to beat the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep my eyes open and my head kept falling . Finally I went to sleep and left the rails on a slow-order curve . The engine jumped the ditch and turned over in a field . That 's all I remember- until I woke up - sitting in my engine - parked on the passing track at Mount Carbon . I 'd dreamed the whole thing . ' " <p> IMG 
##1003615 stu pid boy : Aged between twelve and twenty-two , he is usually a guy who ( a ) thinks he 's grown up when he 's not ; ( b ) thinks everybody is so crazy about him that he can treat you like garbage ; ( c ) takes himself TOO seriously to be taken seriously . If you are not careful , stupid boys can fool you into thinking you 're going to be the one to change them . Only you 're not . <p> Maybe you 've never realized this before , but stupid boys are good to relax with . You do n't need to do much except smile encouragingly as they try out their authoritative manner on you . Meanwhile , you get to think about the really interesting things that matter . Like the face at the window . I saw the face at the window again last night . Cross my heart and point to heaven , I saw it staring right back at me through the glass slats my stepmother Sal turns down to protect my modesty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to the hotel management , but I do n't think he believes me because my stepmother says I 'm making it up . " Young girls will do anything to get attention , " I heard Sal whisper to Morley back in their bedroom . " And Mouse is no exception . She 's still flat as a board and dying for boys to notice her . " Trust Sal to put her finger on a sore spot . I must be the only underdeveloped girl in Nassau . You would n't give me a second look if you walked into the Fort Charlotte Beach Hotel and saw me sitting here listening to the calypso band with Sal and Morley . It 's easy to miss me . My body is as flat and seamless as a worm 's except for my left shoulder , which is slightly higher than my right , so I wear a T-shirt over my bathing suit or a loose-fitting blazer , like the one I have on now . I have told everyone at the hotel I am fifteen and a half but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no curves-I mean , my body is just a tube of skin that ends in a ball of tight brown curls that spring , after a bath , boing-boing from my head . Frankly , there is nothing positive you can say about an underdeveloped bust , although I have met a woman here who has no breasts and gets away with it . Her name is Monique , our social director . She 's the woman who wears her platinum hair in a French chignon even when she 's waterskiing . Monique is the sexiest woman at the Fort Charlotte Beach Hotel . The sight of her makes Sal grumble , " What 's that woman got I have n't got twice over ? " I want to laugh in my stepmother 's face because it 's obvious there 's a little more to having sex appeal than owning a pair of breasts . Even Morley 's old dead eyes look up with interest when Monique saunters by in her tight silver bathing suit , one hand to her neatly pinned-up chignon in case a gust of wind catches her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says I should n't worry because any day now I will get my period and it will make zigzaggy female hips and breasts burst through my baby fat-just the way Moses hit the rock of Horeb and brought forth water for the thirsty Israelites . Cynthia is sitting at the table with me , and so is her brother , Jonathon Allerton Cushman Jr. , whose crew cut is shaved so close to his scalp you can see spaces between the hairs , like the fur around a kitten 's ears . Jonathon and Cynthia and I are drinking Cokes and watching the swimmers in the vision-level glass pool . We like sitting here because we can stare at the swimmers " bodies , especially the fat or ugly ones , without anyone getting mad at us . Behind us , the bartender is making my father a cocktail with a name that rhymes . Bahama Mama . The jigger clanks and froths as if it wants to say : Hey there , Dr. Bradford ! Slurp me down ! It 's happy hour , time to have a party ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bahama Mama . Morley would n't like me telling you this , but he has n't sat in the sun since the day we arrived . He sleeps all day instead . Poor old Morley . He looks like Dr. Kildare on the wrong TV set . Any second from now , the lids will close on his smoky blue eyes and Morley will start snoring . I have Morley 's eyes , which Sal says are prone to showing circles of fatigue . Only my eyes are not dead , but moist and alert constantly darting here and there like the bodies of the lizards that shimmy away from my father 's new wing-tip shoes when we walk to our bungalow beside the peach-colored frangipani bushes . My name , by the way , is Mary Beatrice Bradford , but everyone ( except Morley ) calls me by my nickname-Mouse . " Is Dr. Bradford O.K. ? " Cynthia says , and Sal leans forward and jiggles my father 's arm . " Morley , please ! " Sal says , and Morley swings his big gray head up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was for a minute . " They 're playing our song , " Sal says . Morley yawns and slowly shuffles to his feet . " See you later , Mary Beatrice , Cynthia , and- " Morley looks at Sal . " Jonathon Cushman the second , " Sal says . " Jonathon Allerton Cushman Jr. ! " Jonathon says . " I am Jonathon Jr . and my father is Jonathon Allerton Cushman Sr. It 's the way we say it , sir , in the U.S. of A. " " Is that so ! " Morley smiles sleepily and puts one of his big surgeon hands around Sal 's waist , and I turn again and look at the vision-level pool because there is nothing in the world more embarrassing than watching parents dance . " I never see your dad swim , " Jonathon says when Sal and Morley are in the middle of the floor . " Does n't he know how ? " Frankly , for a boy , Jonathon Jr . is not that smart . Although he is sixteen and one quarter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cents to the gallon , Jonathon still cleans his glasses like a baby , i.e. , he does n't breathe on the lenses like Sal and then wipe , so the lens wo n't smear . Instead he crumples up his cocktail napkin so the wrinkles on it make the dolphins in the hotel logo look crabby and then Jonathon dips the napkin in his drink his drink and rubs his glasses with it . " My stepmother says Morley does n't like sand between his toes . " " Of course her father knows how to swim , " Cynthia says . " What happened to your mother ? " Jonathon says . " She died of a brain tumor when I was four . " " That must be why he lets you call him Morley , " Cynthia sighs . " I wish we could call our dad by his first name . " " Do n't be dumb , Cynth . " Jonathon jerks his closely shaved head toward the dance floor . " Mouse , you wanna- ? " I stand up so quickly I almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He just grabs me by the waist and pushes me out onto the floor where everybody is bobbing around to the calypso music of the Great Sparrow . All the women here are gaga about him , even Sal , who sucks in her funny little tummy if he walks by . To tell the truth , I am just crazy about the Great Sparrow myself . He whistles at Cynthia and me when we are together at the pool , working on our stupid-boy sayings . It 's part of a handbook we are going to publish when we are grown up . A stupid boy , in case you did n't know , is usually between the ages of twelve and twenty-two , although older boys can be stupid too . Cynthia , who is fifteen and three quarters , says Jonathon is a stupid boy on account of his bragging . For instance , he is always telling Monique , the water-ski instructor , and anyone who will listen how he learned to get up on one ski when he was twelve , while Cynthia still has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face at the window is a stupid boy , but I 'm afraid he might just be one because he does nothing except stand outside my bungalow when nobody is watching and stare in . I SAW THE face the first time by accident . In the middle of the night , a noise woke me . I jumped up and opened the glass slats on my bedroom window . At first , I could n't spot anybody in the gloom . I looked and looked , and then , before the tennis court , I saw a bulky figure shuffling like a zombie under the frangipani trees whose blossoms I like to put on my pillow . It was Morley . He held his black leather doctor 's bag in his left hand , like a big purse . Then he turned off the path and I heard a door shut in the southwest wing , which is ringed with spidery white balconies that make me think of the tiers on a wedding cake . I counted the balconies and then I counted the doors , waiting for Morley to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed and began to touch myself . I only touch myself when I 'm sure Sal is asleep . Otherwise , she 'll stick in her head at just the wrong moment and say , " Are you all right , Mouse ? Your breathing sounds strange . " Frankly , I do n't think Sal touches herself or else she would n't blunder in on me and ask stupid questions . I always say , " Yes , I 'm fine , " and go right back to it after she leaves . The first time is usually the hardest . It can take up to eight minutes . Then it 's all downhill after that . Not that I mind . I like doing it when it only takes sixty seconds or so , one after another , easy as pie . That night , I was on number twenty-three when I looked up and saw the face staring at me through my window . And the truly unbelievable thing is I was n't scared , even though I 'm afraid of all the things a girl like me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and not getting your period . My light was out , so all I could see was an inky oval shape the size of a football . And a pair of shoulders in a red T-shirt . I faked a little scream , and the next thing I knew my door was rattling and I heard Sal shouting , For God 's sake , Mouse ! Are you all right ? " Sal could n't walk very well when I let her in , plus her eyes rolled crazily inside her mask of cold cream , but she was still sober enough to pat me on the cheek and tell me to go back to sleep and forget about what happened . " I 'll get Morley to take care of it , " she said , sighing . Only she did n't because the face came back again the very next night . WHERE AM I now ? Oh , yes . On the dance floor with Jonathon . You see how effortless it is to think of interesting things when you are with somebody who does n't expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't get me wrong : I feel grateful to Jonathon for his stupidity . It means I do n't need to care about making a faux pas , which is a nice word for bungle . I can just go ahead and let him talk without a worry in my head . " Mouse ? " Jonathon says . " Yes ? " I reply . " Do all Canadians live in igloos ? " " I 'm afraid so . " " Jeez , that 's terrible ! " Jonathon says . There 's not much point shattering the fantasies of somebody like Jonathon . He does n't know much about anything except how to address the son of a man with the same name or what it costs to fill up a sports car in the U.S. of A. But he does have the greatest president in the world : John F. Kennedy , who winks at you on the TV . I like the way President Kennedy hurries laughing up the steps to Congress so people do n't notice his sore , stooped back . I also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photographs , he 's always smiling at his daughter , Caroline , who is allowed to do handstands in his office and sit next to him in his sailboat . Behind Jonathon 's shoulder , I can see the swimming pool lit with underwater lights , and every so often the turquoise wall turns silver with air bubbles when a swimmer jumps in . But nobody 's watching the pool anymore because the hotel guests are having a wonderful time dancing to the music of the Great Sparrow . And that includes Jonathon and me . THE SECOND TIME I saw the face I did n't scream . For one thing , it was late , almost half past ten , so I was sleepy and , well , more relaxed . Naturally , I could n't see a pair of eyes or a nose because the glass slats got in the way , but I saw a big pink circle that got wider and wider , and smack-dab in the middle of the circle I saw something quivering . It took me a few seconds to realize that the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face 's tongue ! I had my light on , you understand , so it was hard to see what was out there in the dark . At first , I admit , I felt a little panicky . I was n't undressed yet , but all the clothes I 'd worn for the last two days lay on the floor . I got up and began to straighten things out because I did n't want the face to know how messy I was . I picked up my bathing suit , which was still wet from my swim , and rolled it into a ball and threw it into the bathtub . Then , carefully , I folded up a pair of shorts and hung them on the skinny hotel hangers that come apart if the clothes are too heavy . I spied a pair of underpants on the floor of the closet and stuffed them into the pocket of my blazer . I did a few other quick touch-ups , but nothing too major because I was starting to realize the face could n't tell on me . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . So I gave up and just left the other three pairs of shorts lying on the rug . Then I lay down on my bed and wiggled under the sheet . I took off my blouse and pedal pushers , but I did n't take off my underpants or my T-shirt because I did n't want the face to see my rounded shoulder . Then I pulled the sheet down halfway and lifted up my T-shirt ( on my good side ) so the face could see my right breast , and outside in the darkness somebody said , " Aaah ! " I yanked down my T-shirt and pulled the sheet back up to my neck . Some things are better left to the imagination , are n't they ? By then , I was sweating quite a bit because it was very humid , even though Sal had opened all the glass slats of my window to let in a breeze . Cross my heart , it must have been a hundred degrees . So I closed my eyes and tried not to think about the heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the character from 77 Sunset Strip . And soon I forgot about the face because I got carried away picturing the funny little tilt of Kookie 's head when he combs his DA . I usually do n't like boys with greasy hair : Elvis Presley is just a big drip as far as I 'm concerned , but Kookie is different . Kookie does n't shake his pelvis like a stirred-up rattler ; he moves very , very slowly , and naturally , so it feels as if he 's stepping right out of the TV , you know . . . walking up to you and pulling you close for the big clinch and then his nice , smiling mouth is on yours , and you feel his body ( the bottom half , of course ) press against you and your own skinny body starts melting into his hips and then he lays you very slowly down and then . . . well , just as it started to happen , I realized the face was making a really weird garbled noise . At first , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't exactly want to hear what the face was saying . There was n't anything wrong with seeing the face , but I knew I 'd get into trouble if I started having conversations with it . So I did n't say a word . A second later , I heard the sound of feet hurrying off the veranda of our bungalow . And I realized the face had been asking me to open the door and let it in . OVER BY THE bandstand , I can see Morley , the very person who should be doing something about the face , mouthing the words to " Yellow Bird . " In fact , Morley 's lips are opening and shutting like Faye , my goldfish , when I need to change the water in her tank . Now I spot something really strange . Yes , believe it or not , Morley 's old dead eyes are looking right at me ! And I know what he 's thinkingMouse is having herself a whale of a time . So I smile at Morley and try to look happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with somebody like Jonathon , who has to make every step as elaborate as he can so people will admire him . Oh , I beg your pardon . I have to pay attention . Jonathon is whirling me so fast I can hardly keep up . Now we are doing the polka in front of the bandstand , and there is no way I can keep watching my feet . Just as I get myself steady again , I look over and see the Great Sparrow acting as if he is singing just to Cynthia . He is smiling and stretching out his arms toward her in his big Batman sleeves . " I bet that Negro ca n't get up on one ski like me , " Jonathon mutters . " He probably does n't even know how to swim . " Jonathon says " Nigra " for Negro , which is what Americans from the South call people with dark skin . Jonathon is from New Jersey . I think he said it to be mean . We are Canadians and we pronounce the word " knee-grow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few of the Negroes here swim , " Jonathon says . " They are too backward . " Jonathon leans close and something wet and slobbery , like worms , touches my cheek . Double ugh . If this is one of life 's finest pleasures , kissing must be overrated because it does n't make my ears hot or me wet in the place I ca n't speak of here . " Mouse ? " Jonathon sounds scared . " Do n't you like me ? " " I told Sal I 'd be back to our bungalow by nine-thirty . " Jonathon sighs . " Okay , " he says . " I 'll walk you home . " I DO N'T LIKE the way Jonathon says Negro and I do n't like the expression " too backward " either . But I guess you ca n't expect much from a stupid boy who always says the wrong thing because he is trying to impress people . Anyhow , I let Jonathon hold my hand on the path beside the frangipani . It does n't mean a thing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't tell him that . You have to let boys like Jonathon down easy because their egos are n't built to take the truth . At the door , I say good-night and Jonathon looks sad , but I 'm smiling because I 'm going to see the face . Unless it 's already been and gone . Or maybe it 's not going to come at all . Maybe it 's cruel like Morley , who knows how much I want his attention and ca n't make himself give it . Naturally , I 've wondered what the face would do if I let him in . He might very well be a bit nasty . He might put matches between my toes and set them on fire . Or twist my arms behind my back in a wrestling hold like Whipper Billy Watson . Or maybe he 'd take me off to his shack and chain me to the bed like the man who put a girl in a coffin and kept her there for two years . I ca n't help wondering if he let her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I worry about how embarrassed she must have felt getting him to buy her sanitary napkins . There 's no way of knowing for sure , is there ? Suddenly , I hear a bap-bap-bap at the door of our bungalow , as if somebody is excited to see me . And then I understand : the face wants me to let him in . I fumble around , but my door is locked ( I always lock up after coming in-just like Sal ) . The rapping is getting louder and then down toward the floor , right behind the slats I have opened to let in the night air , I spy a pair of large , plainstitched leather sandals . This makes me fumble even more , and when I finally swing the door open , who do I see standing on the step of my bungalow but the Great Sparrow himself . " Chil ' , I 'm sorry . . . " Behind the Great Sparrow 's head , I can see the frangipani tossing in the evening breeze . " Your pa 's goin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " it 's his heart . " I do n't move or speak . I just stand there thinking about how the Great Sparrow leaves off the endings on words the way Sal says I am not supposed to do . And all of a sudden I start to sob , and the Great Sparrow gently takes my arm and we go slowly off down the long path to the hotel under the frangipani trees . I think about Morley lying as if asleep in some dumb ambulance and how I am already starting to miss him and I wonder if he will ever miss me . And for no good reason , I trip over my own two feet and the Great Sparrow catches me and squeezes me up against him . He holds me so close I can hear his heart thudding like far-off thunder , and I think , Morley 's heart is stopping while my heart and the heart of the Great Sparrow are ticking on . This makes me too scared to speak , so I just stand there and let the Great Sparrow hug me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you give somebody who needs comfort , but I think it is the other kind , only I could n't swear on it because I 've never had that kind , not from Jonathon or anyone . Now the Great Sparrow says something against my neck in a voice so whispery I wonder if he really wants me to hear , and then I ca n't see the stars in the cloudless night sky or the frangipani bushes whose flowers Cynthia and I love to pick , because I 'm squeezing my eyes tight , tight , trying to remember the first time I saw the face so I 'll know if it was the Great Sparrow at my window , but I can no longer picture now how the face looked , or if there was even a face at all . in ) Author Affiliation Copyright 1996 by Susan Swan .

##1003616 I Was driving my aunt 's sun-faded tank of a Volvo through the dry sagebrush and deep ravines of eastern Washington when out of nowhere she announced , " We just passed the Horse Heaven Hills . " Instantly I pictured a sloping hillside of tall grasses where a band of horses grazed , their long tails swishing side to side -- a place all horses would escape to if they could . <p> " Really ? " I said , full of curiosity . <p> " No , " she said . " I lied . " My matron aunt did n't lie . We laughed so hard she could n't finish for a while . " We passed them some time back , " she said , " but we were talking , and I could n't stop . I knew you 'd like that name , so I just threw it in , a little late . " <p> My pear-shaped , sharp-eyed aunt -- the liar -- and I were driving back to North Dakota . She had been telling me about the winters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the house and the barn . She was my father 's younger sister , but he had left home at fifteen to join the Civilian Conservation Corps , and she was the one who kept the family history . <p> She had been widowed for many years , and I was single ; both of us were schoolteachers . Because my parents had divorced when I was young , this was the only chance I 'd ever had to see where my father had been raised . I was raised in cities , but even as a small child I had loved all zoos and farms and open country . Though both my North Dakota grandparents had died by then , to me this first trip felt like a return . <p> At dusk we stopped in Miles City , Montana , and tried to find the center of town , but we kept passing the same railroad tracks and cattle yards . We settled for the one motel we saw , and all evening we kept making jokes about how we might decide to get dressed up and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The next day , in North Dakota , south of Minot , my aunt drove us through small , nearly abandoned towns and out into the farm country where she and my dad had lived as children . Thick black-green trees followed the dusty roads , and more than once we caught sight of deer gliding in the shadows . <p> " I do n't remember deer , " my aunt told me . " I do n't think the windbreak trees were big enough to shelter deer back then . " <p> Where I had expected miles of flat and empty prairie , the land rolled away in riffling swales of deep green wheat , fields of golden sunflowers , and pools of pale blue flax . Most of the homestead farms had been sold , consumed by vast wheat operations ; the houses were moved , torn down , or burned . <p> When we passed a certain farm , a two-story white house with no front porch or adornment , she said , " That 's where cousin Margarete lived . She lived there by herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flour and yeast and scalded milk , the milk smell like burned sugar . The baby , sleeping in a basket on a chair , had the round , tight plumpness of bread rising in a bowl . Wind shrieked under the eaves . <p> Margarete had come to dread the wind . She heard it as she lay in bed at night , the incessant rush of yards and yards of silk drawn through a knothole . She felt the whole house shudder in the wind , a house anchored to rock and built of thick-sawn wooden planks and plaster . <p> A blizzard had blown up in the night , and when she awakened , sheets of thin ice glistened on the inside of the windowpanes . Her husband rose from bed , a dim shadow at the outskirts of her dream . He let her sleep while he went down to light the stove and heat the kitchen for her and the baby . <p> Friedrich was always gone out to his chores before she came downstairs . As she worked in the kitchen , kneading bread , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mornings he followed a stout rope strung from the house to the barn , where he fed his stock and milked . He would return hot , sweating under woolen shirts , his cheeks red and his beard tinkling with ice . His coveralls came off in a shower of snow and wet hay chaff . <p> Theirs was not a common marriage . Each had parents who had sailed from German colonies in Russia . Friedrich had farmed for his father and had not married until late in life . When he did marry , he chose a woman no one thought of as a bride . Margarete was tall and large-boned , her broad figure shaped like two whisk brooms set stump to stump upon each other . She wore long dresses and linen aprons washed to the softness of thick pressed paper . With her knuckled feet in stout leather boots and her dark hair drawn back in a bun , she stood like a monolith . Even in the brief high color of her youth , children had run from her . <p> Margarete had been born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone . She had been the oldest of nine living children . In her new family , in her own house , in her own kitchen , she seldom smiled , but contentment surprised her , rising in her body like warm water . <p> That morning she went about assembling breakfast : sweet kuchen and pale sausages , pickled watermelon rind and golden jellies from the cellar , strong-tasting butter she had churned herself , and cheese . She fed the baby , heated water , and bathed the small girl in a basin . <p> She did not know when to expect her husband . After he milked the cow each day , small emergencies arose-the cow had kicked down a board in her stall ; mice had gnawed through harness ; one of the oxen had rubbed its hind leg raw . Sometimes he needed her to help , and she awoke to an urgency that drew her without complaint into the black , frozen morning . <p> The wind rose like an inhalation , sucking at the doors . The sheets of blue ice shrank away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Above , snow drove past in horizontal lines . She could not see the barn at all , and the wind tormented her , like an alarm she could n't answer , or a kettle screaming on the stove , or a window banging in the night . <p> Just before noon she began to feel angry . Disappointment dropped inside her , a falling of her spirits and her hopes . She had arranged the table for breakfast in her yellow-and-white kitchen , the floor scrubbed and shining , the bread baked and cooling on the stove . The baby had begun to fuss and wince in her sleep , as if in her dreams she 'd tasted bitter food . <p> Margarete pulled on a second pair of woolen stockings and strapped the baby to her chest with a shawl crossed in front of her and tied behind . Over this she buttoned a heavy coat , and she wrapped a knitted scarf around her head . <p> At first she could n't force the door . The wind had sucked it closed in a tight seal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling up and down its length for the guide rope . When she had it in her gloves , she yanked on it with all her strength . It was so weighted with snow and ice that it hung as if anchored in the sea . It scarcely gave at all . <p> She hesitated . To go was to disappear into the snow and wind . She thought she should take the baby back-leave her in the basket , safe . But if Friedrich was hurt , she 'd want the baby with her . In a few more hours the snow would be too deep for her to return to the house . She was n't sure she could go on without the small weight of the child resting on her chest . <p> She took a step into the snow and sank up to her thighs . Hauling on the rope , she took another step . Already the heat of her breath steamed her cheeks and fogged her vision . She was deaf and blind . When she stopped to listen , tears formed in her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large woman , and strong . She forced another step , and another . The track behind her vanished under drifting snow . What made her go on ? Another woman would stay in the house , would chop wood and wait , would make do until the storm had passed , and then find her husband in the barn , stranded there but safe . <p> But Friedrich had chosen Margarete because he saw in her strength . He loved her for her size , her very bulk . In their bed at night he could balance his entire narrow body on her body while she held him in her arms . She would have liked to have been born small and delicate , willowy and thin ; she would like to be the soft , protected one . But his love was a physical truth to her -- almost a location . She took comfort in it ; she was unafraid . <p> She fought on toward the barn . The baby , as if she meant to rejoin her mother 's body , lay silent , burrowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to breathe and then went on , following the rope . <p> When it disappeared under the snow , she sank down to her knees and forced her hands to grip . She stood and set her bones against the pull . She pulled beyond her strength until the rope began to creak and give . Slowly she drew from the snow the frayed end of the line , encased in a rock of ice . It no longer reached the barn . The frozen rope hurt her hands , but she could not let it drop . She subsided in the snow , her wet skirts frozen now , and rising up around her like a black umbrella . <p> Fear made the blood throb in her face and neck . Fear shimmered in her veins , and she seemed able to see and feel and hear more . Her thoughts ran fast . In her mind she traced the way back and the way ahead . But the fear was like a paralyzing drug . It turned her limbs to bags of grain . If she went ahead without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the house . <p> IMG 
##1003617 A young boy discovers Luke , his Angel Friend , who tells him to " do something nice for the people you love . " <p> Everyone has a favorite Christmas memory . For me it came gift-wrapped as a dream long , long ago and is with me still . The dream was about an angel named Luke who taught me a special lesson . And to this day , I believe the dream was real . I suppose the events of that Christmas Eve had something to do with it . Mounds of snow were silently piling up outside the window of our Indiana farmhouse . Inside , Dad tossed another log on the fire . I remember how it crackled and scented the room . And overlooking the entire scene was the tree : a glorious fresh-cut pine , lovingly decorated by me , my little sister Molly , Mom , and Dad . Mom popped some corn ; then we all nestled together on the couch , surrounded by the warmth of the fire and watching the twinkling lights of the tree reflect in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had lifted her high on his shoulders to place a white angel with gold wings on the top bough . But even though it was the most beautiful tree I had ever seen , I could n't help eyeing the brightly colored boxes underneath in eager anticipation of Christmas morning . Our family has a Christmas tradition : each year , one of us recites the Christmas story of the birth of Jesus . This year it was Mom 's turn . In colorful detail , Mom retold the story of Jesus " birth . How the holy child was born in a manger . Of how wise men came from afar to deliver gifts of gold , frankincense , and myrrh to the Child in the manger-the real reason why we give presents at Christmastime . Dad stuffed some popcorn in his mouth just as Molly asked him whether Jesus had any other visitors that night . We giggled as Dad chewed the popcorn quickly . " Well , sure , " Dad said , brushing a few kernels off his lap . " Angels were there , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What exactly are angels ? " I wondered . " Angels are kind of God 's messengers , " he said . " They are God 's gift to us . Angels protect us and guide us in the right direction . And they are everywhere . " We learned that people from different religions and countries believe in angels . People in Italy , France , Israel , Japan , Mexico , and Russia-wherever there are people , angels are there to guide them . " But how do they get around without cars ? " Molly wondered . " Angel wings , " Dad answered , pointing to the gold wings on the angel ornament . Thinking back , it must have been the warm fire , flickering lights , and gentle story that gave way to deep yawns and sleepy eyes . Mom and Dad carried us up the stairs and tucked Molly and me into bed . As I lay there watching the snow fall outside the window by my bed , I drifted off that night not with the usual Christmas thoughts of toys . Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angels lulled me into sleep . That 's when it happened-the dream . Suddenly , angels were everywhere-all over my room , floating and singing and flying about . Tall angels with giant wings , short angels with little ones . Chubby ones and thin ones . Blue angels , yellow angels , red angels , black angels , white angels-angels of every color of the rainbow . Hundreds and thousands of them ! It made me happy just to watch them . And in the midst of all these dancing angels stood one somehow different from all the rest . Tall with long fluffy wings and brown hair that fell to his shoulders , he had a friendly , strangely familiar face . He flew right toward me , landing right next to me . " Hello , Michael , " he said . " How do you know my name ? " " Michael , you do n't recognize me , but I know you . After all , I 've been with you since you were born , " he said with a smile . " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can call me Luke . " " What do you mean you 've been with me ? " I asked . " I do n't remember you . " " Michael , everyone has a guardian angel assigned to him or her when they are first born , " Luke explained . " You may not see us , but we 're there . Take my word for it . " " You 're my Angel Friend ? " I said . " Absolutely , " replied Luke . " Cool , " I said , genuinely impressed . " But Luke , what do you do all day ? " " Every day your Mom and Dad go to their jobs at work , right ? " Luke inquired . I nodded . " I have the best job in the world , " he continued . " My job is to be your Angel Friend . I help you do the right thing , and sometimes that is n't easy . " I whisper to you to be kind to others , nudge you to help your parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homework on time , brush your teeth , and say your prayers-things like that , " Luke replied . " And I also steer you away from trouble . " Oh-oh . How much did Luke know ? " You know what trouble is . Do n't you , Michael ? " " Sure , " I said , immediately remembering the fistfight with Andy at school and the argument I had with Molly at breakfast over who got the cereal box toy . " You really should have given little Molly the cereal toy , Michael . " ( Yep , he knew all about it . ) " Luke , it 's hard to be good all the time , " I confessed . " Aahh . That 's where I can help ! " Luke broke in . " How , Luke ? " " There 's a little thing that I 've learned over the last ... oh ... million years or so to help little boys like you . It 's called an Angel Promise . " " What 's an Angel Promise ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works like this : An Angel Promise is like a gift , Michael . After all , the best gifts come from the heart . " " But I do n't have any gold like the wise men , Luke . " " You do n't need gold , Michael , " Luke said , lifting my chin up with his finger . " Whenever you do something nice for other people , or do what you 're supposed to do , like taking the dog for a walk , you 're making an Angel Promise . And when you keep your promise , that not only makes me happy , it makes God happy as well . " " Have I made Angel Promises without knowing it ? " I wondered . " Sure , " Luke said . " When you made that special Christmas card at school for your grandparents , raked the leaves for your retired neighbor Mr. James , and shared your bicycle with Molly while hers was broken , you made an Angel Promise . It 's not always something you do , either . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like arguing with Molly , fighting with friends , or being disrespectful . " Then Luke looked down into my eyes and said : " Michael , from now on , whenever you make an Angel Promise , I want you to know that I will hold it close to my heart and pray that you carry it out . When you do , my heart dances . " Suddenly , Luke flapped his giant wings and slowly headed off to join the other angels in the distance . " Remember , Michael , I 'm always with you , " Luke said . " I 'm always there to help you , even though you ca n't see me . " " But I still do n't know enough about Angel Promises , " I cried after him , watching him fade away . " Do n't worry , " Luke said without turning . " You 'll know . You 'll know . " I woke up Christmas morning feeling so happy , I sat up in my bed and began flapping my arms like angel wings ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do something nice for the people you love , " Luke had said . But what ? I wondered , looking around my room . I knew stacks of gifts waited for me downstairs , yet I had nothing wrapped up to give my parents or Molly for Christmas . Should I give Dad my Little League trophy ? Maybe I should give Mom my trading cards ? And what about Molly ? My piggy bank yielded only $3.27 -- certainly not enough to buy something nice . Besides , it 's Christmas Day ! Out of nowhere , almost in a whisper , I heard the words " Angel Promises . " That 's it ! I dug in my dresser drawer and found the cereal box toy I had hidden yesterday . I wrapped it in colored paper and addressed it to Molly with an IOU , promising her every cereal box toy for a whole year . Then I took out some construction paper , scissors , string , and set to work . I traced a big red heart , then cut it out . I punched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of string through it and slipped it into a large envelope . I heard Mom calling me from downstairs . " Where have you been , Michael ? " Mom asked . " Are you feeling OK ? I expected you to be the first one down here today . " " I was busy with something , " I answered , walking into the living room and placing my gifts with the others . Soon the whole family gathered around the Christmas tree to exchange presents . " I have gifts for all of you , " I announced . " Would you please open them first ? " They all looked surprised . This was n't like me at all ! I was usually first in line to open presents . When Molly unwrapped the toy , she looked at it and smiled , handing the handwritten IOU to Mom . " What does it say ? " Molly asked . Mom read it to her , then Molly gave me a curious smile . " Thank you , Michael , " she stammered , looking down at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know what got into you , but I like it ! " I handed Mom and Dad the large envelope . They opened it , holding the heart in the air , and read the verse out loud : " I love you Mom and Dad . This is my Angel Promise . Love , Michael &; Luke . " Mom gently dangled the heart in the air while Dad looked on a little puzzled . " Michael , this is the most beautiful gift we 've ever received , " Mom said , still stunned . " But , Michael , who is Luke ? " Dad finally asked . " Luke 's my own special Angel Friend who gave me the idea of Angel Promises-special promises from the heart , " I said . Looking at my family 's smiling faces , I knew that Angel Promises not only made Luke happy but me as well , because in that moment I felt my heart really dance . " Whoever Luke is , I think I like him , " Dad laughed , lifting me up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branch just below the very top . And as I did , I glanced up at the angel resting silently above and thought I saw him wink. 
##1003618 From the moment he entered the Pearly Gates , heavenly peace was never quite the same . Photograph <p> Once upon a time there was , in paradise , a most unhappy cherub who was known throughout heaven as The Littlest Angel . He was exactly four years , six months , five days , seven hours , and 42 minutes old when he presented himself to the Gatekeeper . The Littlest Angel pretended not to be afraid , but his lower lip trembled , and a tear disgraced him by coming to a halt at the tip of his small nose . Being without a handkerchief , he tried to hide the evidence by snuffing . A most unangelic sound , which caused the Gatekeeper to blot the page ! From that moment on , the heavenly peace was never quite the same . The Littlest Angel always sang off-key at the heavenly choir practice . He always arrived late to nightly prayers , and he always knocked everyone 's wings askew as he darted into place . And his appearance was even worse than his conduct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an angel ! And that was correct , for his halo was permanently tarnished from where he held it with one hand when he ran , and he was always running . Even when he was still , it never behaved as a halo should . It was always slipping down over his right eye , or over his left eye . . . or else , just for pure meanness , slipping off his head and rolling away so he 'd have to chase after it ! And his wings were neither useful nor ornamental . All paradise held its breath whenever he prepared to take off . He would teeter this way and that way , and after a few false starts , he would shut his eyes , hold his nose , and then hurl himself into space ! However , owing to the fact that he always forgot to move his wings , the Littlest Angel always fell head over halo ! It was also reported , and never denied , that whenever he was nervous , which was most of the time , he bit his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Littlest Angel would have to be disciplined . And so he was directed to present himself before an angel of the peace . He combed his hair , dusted his wings , and scrambled into an almost clean garment ; then , with a heavy heart , he trudged to the place of judgment . He tried to postpone the dreaded ordeal by pausing to inspect the long list of new arrivals , although all heaven knew that he could n't read . And he idled more than several moments to examine a display of harps , although everyone in the celestial city knew that he could n't play a note . But at last he came to a doorway with golden scales above it . To the Littlest Angel 's surprise , he heard a merry voice singing ! The Littlest Angel removed his halo , breathed upon it heavily , and polished it upon his robe . Then he tiptoed in . The singer , known as the Understanding Angel , looked down at the small culprit who tried to hide by tucking his head into his robe like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Oh ! So you 're the one who 's been making heaven so unheavenly ! Come here and tell me all about it ! " Before he knew it , the Littlest Angel found himself explaining how hard it was to be suddenly transformed into an angel . And no matter what the archangels said , he 'd only swung once , well maybe two or three times , on the golden gates . Earth had been full of trees to climb , brooks to fish , and caves to explore . There was nothing for a small angel to do in paradise . The Understanding Angel smiled and asked what would make him most happy . The cherub thought for a moment and whispered in his ear . " If only I could have the box under my bed back home . " The Angel nodded and a messenger was sent to bring the box to paradise . In those days that followed , everyone wondered at the change in the Littlest Angel , for he was the happiest of all the cherubs in the kingdom . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that the most fastidious could wish for . And on trips to Elysian Fields , it could be said , and truly said , that he flew like an angel ! It came to pass that Jesus , the Son of God , was to be born in Bethlehem . All the angels rejoiced at the coming of the Christ child . The angels and archangels , the Gatekeeper , the Wingmaker , and even the Halosmith put aside their tasks to prepare gifts for the blessed infant . All but the Littlest Angel . He sat himself down on the topmost step of the golden stairs . What could he give to the Son of God ? At one time , he dreamed of composing a hymn of adoration . But the Littlest Angel was woefully wanting in musical talent . Then he wanted to write a prayer . It would be the first prayer heard by the Christ child ! But the Littlest Angel was also lacking in literary skill . At last he decided on a gift and on the day of the miracle , he pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rough box before God 's throne . His was an unsightly box next to all the other gifts ! When the Littlest Angel saw this , he wished to reclaim his shabby gift before God noticed . it . But it was too late ! God 's hand came to rest on the Littlest Angel 's gift . The box was opened before the eyes of God and all his heavenly host . Inside there was a butterfly with golden wings , captured on the hills above Jerusalem , and a sky-blue egg from a bird 's nest . At the bottom of the box , there was a toothmarked leather collar , worn by his dog , who had died as he had lived , in absolute love and devotion . The Littlest Angel wept hot , bitter tears , for now he knew that instead of honoring the Son of God , he had been most blasphemous . In terror , he turned to run and hide from the divine wrath of the Heavenly Father , but instead he fell and rolled to the foot of the heavenly throne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying , " Of all the gifts this small box pleases me most . Its contents are of the earth and of men , and my Son is born to be king of both . I accept this gift in his name . " There was a pause ; then the box began to glow with an unearthly light , which became a radiant brilliance that blinded the eyes of all the angels ! Only the Littlest Angel saw the box rise and arch away from heaven to shed its clear , white light over a stable where a child was born . Earthly eyes could never know that the lowly gift of the Littlest Angel was what all men would call forever , " The shining star of Bethlehem ! " 
##1003620 Poetry : Beyond the Stars <p> I watch her see beyond the stars , past the gleaming moon . Dreaming herself so far from here , each breath , a plea of " soon . " I hear her whisper words at night , reaching from her sleep . With waking comes the sadness , hope sits on hills so steep . I listen to the laughter , which scorns her hopes and dreams . Words that tear at healing wounds , her tears a flowing stream . I move my lips to comfort her , to ease away her pain . No sounds are uttered on my part , my efforts are in vain . She lives a life in a lonely world , no one understands . One day she 'll fly far from here , and find peace in other lands . <p> 
##1003622 THOUGHTS <p> The child lived alone , that was the way it always had been . She liked the solitude ; it suited her . She could do whatever she pleased , and her home was never cluttered with the thoughts of others . No , only her own thoughts to fill the cupboards and take up floor space . No one to try to tidy them up , dust them off , try to understand them ; only the child alone with her thoughts . She was happy for a long time by herself ; after all , what else would she need ? <p> What indeed ? She found herself wondering what could possibly be missing the day she smashed three different thoughts against she wall . She was dissatisfied that day , and by the time the third thought lay in glittering pieces on the floor , she was also crying . Screaming at the broken thought , tears streaming down her face , she realized that maybe it would be interesting to have some new thoughts around . Not too many , just enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some new thoughts would be the trick , even if it would mean a new person along with them . <p> The child opened the door to her home and looked out for the first time in her life . There were plenty of children around , but only one , a girl about her own age , seemed to be the perfect person to bring in new thoughts . Judging by the ones the new girl had scattered around her on the ground , they would get along well . They had a few of the same thoughts , but many were different . It would be fun to exchange . <p> She beckoned to the little girl who gathered up her thoughts and came along . The child discovered her new friend 's name was Jenea , and the child found she liked Jenea better with each new thought . Getting used to different thoughts in the child 's home was a little strange , but she also found it pleasant . <p> During the next few months , each child found her thoughts disappearing and changing , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was around this time that they began to show each other their dark thoughts . The child was ashamed of hers ; she kept them locked in a cupboard , and rarely even looked at them . She trusted Jenea to not use these dark thoughts against her . Jenea was fascinated when she saw them . Exclaiming over them , and pulling each one carefully out of the cupboard , Jenea made sure the child told her everything about each one of them . <p> When the child asked to see Jenea 's dark thoughts , the other girl shrugged and pulled a bag attacked to a chain from around her neck and tossed it to her . Inside lay the thoughts like little dead jewels . The child spilled them onto the floor to look at them , but soon put them away . Even touching them gave her the chills . <p> The next morning , the child found one of Jenea 's dark thoughts scattered among the usual thoughts on the floor . The child did not think much of it . After all , everyone gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it was still there the next day . By the time it had been there long enough to meld with one of her own thoughts , the child was so used to it that she did not even notice . Nor did she notice that she had been going to visit her own dark thoughts more often than usual . <p> In less than a year from when the child first met Jenea , all of Jenea 's dark thoughts had melded with one of the child 's . Only one thought of the child 's was left in the state in which it began . Of course , the child did not notice at first . She was enjoying herself too much with Jenea . Her one pure thought was hidden under the clutter of the usual thoughts , so she was unable to notice that each of her own had a little dull jewel in the center . <p> The child happened to be cleaning up one day while Jenea was out , when she found her only remaining pure thought . She stopped and admired it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Picking up one of her usual thoughts , she noticed for the first time the little cloudy jewel inside . On impulse , she threw the dark thought remained intact . Even when the child threw the dark thought itself against the wall , it merely bounced off , without a chip . The child began smashing all the thoughts with darkness inside . She then gathered up all of Jenea 's thoughts and threw them out the door . After that moment , she saw no trace of Jenea . <p> The child lay on the floor and cried for days . It was so unfair , she wailed to herself , why would she do that to me ? Turning over , she saw the only thought that was left . She cradled it to herself and wondered why it had been saved . In its glittery smoothness , the thought reflected her . Perhaps , yes perhaps , if she met another person like Jenea , perhaps this same thought would remain pure . Perhaps she could never lose herself totally . Yes , that would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's floor was again littered with thoughts . Some good , some bad , but all her own and comfortable . She needed something new to spice things up .

##1003629 Jill 's and Gretel 's envy of each other pulled them apartuntil one bittersweet summer night ... By Alice Hoffman <p> Gretel stands by the gate , her fingers wrapped around the metal fence post . There are the roses , which she planted herself . Once they were nothing more than seedlings wrapped in brown paper and string , but with time they 've become a gorgeous torrent of blooms , tumbling over the fence . Where the cherry tree had been there is now a bed of English ivy , the growth so dense and thick you 'd think it had been there forever . The sky is terrifically blue and clear ; it 's the only thing that has remained the same . Those clouds have always turned to castles when you squint your eyes , but once you blink , they 're gone . Blink again and you 'll come to believe you never even saw them in the first place . It was all your imagination , that 's what you 'll start to think ; it was all in your mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to perfection . Bees are hovering above the lawn ; Gretel can hear them , in spite of the noise echoing from the Southern State Highway . She sits cross-legged on the grass , although this is no longer her house and has n't been for some time , nearly five years . She leans down and listens to the sound of the bees , and she ca n't help but wonder why she never heard them during all the years she lived here . Maybe she was n't paying attention , but she 's paying attention now . There 's Jill , Gretel 's oldest friend in the world , walking down the street . Gretel can divine Jill 's presence without turning her head ; she knows the slap of Jill 's clogs on the cement and the bonechilling squeak Jill 's son Leonardo manages to summon forth when he rides his bicycle . " What are you doing over there ? " Jill calls . Gretel waves from the lawn , then shades her eyes against the sun so she can see her childhood friend more clearly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her three children : Leonardo , age seven ; Eddie Junior , who 's called Doc ; and the baby , Angela , who at eleven months is already walking . Jill , whose blonde hair is pulled into a ponytail and who , even after three pregnancies , still has the legs to wear short shorts , plops the baby down on the lawn and marches over to Gretel . " Are you crazy ? " Jill asks . " We hate these people . " She nods to Gretel 's old house . " Nobody in the neighborhood talks to them . Get up , " she suggests and gives Gretel a little kick in the shin to prove her point . " Move it . " " Ow , " Gretel says , but she moves it all the same . " They 're a horrible family , " Jill says as she heads for Angela , who is tearing leaves from an ornamental shrub . " If they see us on their property , they 'll call the police . Pigs , " she calls over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party , " she tells Gretel . " But neither did you . " " There used to be block parties ? " Gretel asks . Jill shakes her head when she considers what a pathetic specimen Gretel was and perhaps still is , in spite of her degree from NYU and the five years she 's spent in Manhattan . " Every August , " she informs Gretel , who clearly still has her head in the clouds . " My mother always made macaroni salad . Your mother was always working . " Gretel and Jill have looped arms ; they 're following Jill 's kids down the street to the Harringtons " house -- Jill 's house now , since her parents have moved to a condo in Fort Lauderdale , allowing Jill and her husband to pay off the place in installments . " Believe me , we 'll still be paying it off from our graves , " Jill has cheerfully informed Gretel , not that she has to tell anyone that Eddie is not exactly a financial genius . Luckily , the LoPaccas have taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own delivery route way out on the Island . His sister , Terry , is the real heir apparent and basically runs the LoPaccas " bread factory . " Terry has a shrine to your brother set up in her bedroom , " Jill tells Gretel as they follow the kids along . " Still ? " Gretel asks . " You 'd think she 'd be over him . " Gretel 's brother was killed in a freak accident , and anyway , he and Terry only went out for a short time , years ago . " Oh my God , Jason 's like a saint in her eyes . I pity her husband . " " She got married ? " Gretel asks . Everyone 's doing it , it seems . Except for her . " Oh yeah . But I swear she gets down on her knees and says a Hail Mary in front of a picture of your brother before she gets into bed and f -- s her husband . " Jill suddenly stops , hands on her hips . " What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her oldest , who has just narrowly escaped being hit by a car . " Nothing , " he answers . " Nothing , my ass , " Jill mutters . " You watch where you 're going , " she tells her son . " No driver 's going to watch out for you . " Gretel feels so dreamy being back here in June . It was always her favorite time of the year , this glorious , untrustworthy month when anything seems possible . Here they are at Jill 's house , a destination Gretel has reached a million times before . She takes a good look now and realizes how small the house is , how impossibly green the grass seems to be . " Is this real ? " Gretel says , leaning over and pulling out a handful of turf . " Yes , it 's real , " Jill says . It 's never easy to tell whether or not Jill 's insulted ; she still has a permanent pout . " Eddie works like a dog on this lawn . You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little pool set out in the backyard , just as there was when Jill and Gretel were kids . Back then , Jill 's mother was too distracted and depressed to notice much of what they were doing , but Jill watches Angela like a hawk . " Do n't you push your sister , " she shouts at Doc as she fills the pool with the hose . " And do n't think I ca n't see everything you do . " Doc , who 's just turned five , sits contritely on the grass . They can all hear Leo 's bike out on the street , squeaking and whining as he rides in circles and figure eights . Gretel sprawls in a lawn chair . She used to see this yard from her own bedroom window , but no one in her family lives here anymore . Her mother and brother are dead ; her father lives on the North Shore with his second wife ; even her cousin Margot moved to Florida after she remarried . Jill has gone into the kitchen for some Kool-Aid and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drink , she throws herself down on the plastic lawn chair beside Gretel 's . " Give me the strength to go on , " she cries . " Cigarette ? " She pulls a pack from her shorts pocket . " I quit , " Gretel informs her friend . " Seriously ? Completely ? " Whenever Jill came into the city , she and Gretel went to clubs and smoked and drank and complained about their lives , but of course Jill has n't been into the city once since Angela was born , and during that time , Gretel has quit a lot of things . She stopped cutting her own hair , for instance , and now pays to have it styled . She stopped crying in the middle of the night . She stopped feeling that everyone 's bad fortune was her responsibility-all right , maybe she feels it occasionally , but whenever she does , she goes out and buys a new pair of earrings and that seems to help , especially if they 're expensive . " I ca n't believe it ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blue lapis hearts Gretel recently bought for herself . She 's actually jealous . Of Gretel . Jill 's husband , Eddie , has absolutely forbidden pierced ears , which he refers to as a disfigurement . He wo n't even let Jill plead her case , and forget about Angela , who would look so cute with little pearl studs ; Eddie wo n't hear of it . Jill almost sneaked Angela over to her cousin Marianne 's last week , since Marianne pierces ears with a sharp needle right at her kitchen table , but it was n't worth the fight she 'd have had to have with Eddie . Not that she listens to him . Not really . He never liked her going into the city to see Gretel , to all those crummy apartments , with all those weird roommates , and that never stopped Jill . If Eddie knew the half of it-the clubs they went to , the lunatic roommate who stood out on a window ledge above Fourteenth Street convinced she could fly-he would go berserk . The real reason Jill and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years has nothing to do with Eddie -at least , not in that way . It 's jealousy , that 's the problem ; it 's coveting something you 'd never actually want in real life but still desire in your dreams , the silliest dreams , the ones you simply ca n't shake , even now , when you 're not a kid anymore and should know better than to traffic in envy . Each wants a bit of the other 's life . Not the whole thing , of course , not the loneliness or the exhaustion ; just the best parts , the prizes . " Angela is the cutest girl in the world , " Gretel decides . The late afternoon is more scorching than ever , even in Jill 's shady backyard . Gretel has been drinking Kool-Aid , which is a great deal sweeter than she had remembered , and watching the kids , who are all in the pool , making so much noise the sound blends together into one primitive beat . She believes her appraisal of Angela to be unbiased , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know , " Jill agrees . " Especially when she 's sleeping . " They can hear Eddie 's truck when he pulls into the driveway , and they look at each other and laugh . Eddie always made sure you knew he was around . " Hey , hey , hey , " he shouts when he sees Jill and Gretel . " Great to see you , " he tells Gretel when she goes to greet him . He puts his arm around her and pulls her too close . " You have never looked better , " he adds . " Wow . " " Oh , shut up , " Jill tells him . " You shut up , " he says , and he leans down to kiss her , a real kiss , as if they were madly in love . Maybe Jill and Eddie are still crazy about each other ; maybe they always have been . Gretel has always had a difficult time understanding why people are drawn to each other and why they break apart . Still , she knows one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're the one wrapped up in its arms . " Terry 's coming for dinner , " Eddie says as he heads for the house to take a shower . " Thanks for telling me , " Jill shouts after him . Gretel ca n't help but wonder if she 's genetically incapable of forming a lasting relationship . Her only real boyfriend in high school was a disaster , and everyone she dated in college was a disappointment of one sort or another . She 's here at Jill 's for the weekend before heading to California , where Eugene Kessler , an old friend of her brother 's whom no one has seen for ages , has resurfaced to publish a magazine in Menlo Park . Gretel has been hired as associate editor , and Jill is green with envy . At last . " You 'll have an expense account . " Lately , Jill gets a shimmery look whenever she talks about Gretel 's future . You 'd think she was the one who 'd soon be returning people 's manuscripts and fixing French roast coffee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't think so , " Gretel says , although if she did , they would all be black-her color . They 're carrying cups and toys into the kitchen , which is broiling hot . There 's a lasagna in the oven-Jill hopes enough for Terry and her husband to be added to the dinner table . " You 'll meet . somebody in a band the first week you 're in California . A guitarist . No , a drummer . They 're cuter , and they do n't have such big egos . " Gretel laughs and gets herself a cold beer . " Dream on , " she says , but all the same , she 's feeling little pinpricks of hope . By the time the salad is fixed and the kids " hands washed , Terry and her husband , Tim , who works in the accounting department at the LoPaccas " bakery , have arrived . Oh my God , Gretel , you look terrific , " Terry says , hugging Gretel as if they were once best friends , instead of acquaintances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other on the street . " Jason 's sister , " Terry informs her husband . " It breaks my heart , " Terry tells Gretel . " Every time I think about what might have been . " When Eddie comes in , his hair wet from the shower , the kitchen is too crowded and unbelievably hot . " No lasagna for me , " Tim says when Jill is about to serve him . " Just salad . " " You do n't like lasagna ? " Eddie asks . " Let me put it this way , " Tim says . " I used to be Paul . Now I 'm John . " For some reason , Gretel laughs out loud , then quickly covers her mouth with her hand . Eddie stares at his brother-in-law . " What 's that supposed to mean ? " he asks . " Eddie , " Jill warns as she serves Terry and then the kids . " No , really . Is that supposed to mean something ? " " It means nothing , " Terry tells her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Gretel looks at Tim , who is calmly eating a slice of tomato . He 's not insulted in the least . Obviously , he 's been through dinners like this before . " The food 's fantastic , " Gretel tells Jill , who rolls her eyes and looks like she 'd like to head for the hills . " Am I supposed to be Paul , and you 're John because you 're a superior being ? Is that what you 're saying ? " Eddie asks Tim . " Will you just shut up ? " Jill says . " Maybe you 're Ringo . " " I do n't think so . " Eddie grins . " No way . " When he smiles , Gretel can see why Jill fell for him in the first place . He definitely has his appeal . Later , while Jill is putting the two youngest kids to bed and Terry is clearing the table , Eddie comes up behind Gretel while she 's washing the dishes . " Did you ever think all you needed was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He likes to do this , play with her , test her loyalty to Jill . " You know what I 'd really like ? " Gretel whispers , her voice low and sweet . Eddie puts his hands on her waist and moves closer . " For you to do the pots , " Gretel says . " Hey , baby , it 's your loss , " Eddie tells her when she tosses him the sopping-wet sponge . Gretel goes out to the patio , where they 'll be having drinks and dessert . There 's the smell of grass and of a barbecue in someone else 's yard . " What a moron Eddie is , " Terry says as she pours Gretel a glass of wine . It 's still light enough for Terry 's husband to toss a ball around with Leonardo . It 's light enough for Gretel to see tears in Terry 's eyes . " Sorry , " Terry apologizes . " I get this way when I think of your brother . " Gretel knows this often happens when a man dies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ betray those who love him . " You would n't have been happy with him , " Gretel tells Terry , and it 's the truth . Jason was too wounded and too pure for anything as simple as happiness . " You would have been miserable . " Out in the grass , Tim throws the ball carefully so Leo can catch it every single time . " I 'm the champion , " Leo shouts . " I 'm the best in the world . " " I try to tell myself the past is the past . Let it go . " Terry wipes her eyes with the back of her hand and pulls herself together . Gretel stares past the fences that separated her yard from Jill 's . It was so long ago when they would climb out their windows at night . In the summer , everyone else would be fast asleep with their windows wide open or their air conditioners turned on , but not them . They had too much to accomplish ; they had their whole lives ahead of them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Eddie asks when he comes out with some plastic chairs and a cooler of beer . " Suicide Alley . " " What 's suicide ? " Leonardo calls from the grass . " Thank you so much for that lovely addition to his vocabulary , " Jill says to Eddie . She 's brought out the cheesecake she fixed early that morning , which she cuts into slices to serve on little rose-patterned plates that her mother always said were too fragile for everyday use . " Hey , it 's life . You want to protect him from everything . " " That 's right , " Jill says . " I do . " Gretel cracks up , and Jill joins right in . " Was that funny ? " Eddie asks . " Did I miss something ? " " Two girls killed themselves right down the street , " Terry informs Gretel . " Was it last week ? " " The last day of May , " Jill says . " Easy , " she calls to Tim after he pitches a fastball to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " We had Newsday here interviewing everybody , and who do they pick to talk to ? Those creeps who bought your old house , Gretel . The Shmos , or whatever their name is . They said this is an alienated neighborhood . Well , they 're definitely alienated now . No one will ever talk to them-not on this block . That 's for sure . " " Sounds like they do n't care , " Gretel says . Twilight is already falling , like ashes , like purple clouds . " Everybody cares , " Jill says . That night , in the lower bunk of Leonardo 's bed , Gretel ca n't sleep . It 's not the heat or the sound of Leo grinding his teeth that keeps her awake . It 's the deepness of the night ; it 's the way her memories wo n't leave her alone . A long time ago , Gretel set up a tightrope in her backyard , stretching a jump rope between two pine trees . She had on black ballet slippers that her grandmother had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She practiced for hours , but she could n't take a single step on the rope without falling . The last time she fell , she looked up to see Jill out in her yard . Through the grid of metal fences , Jill had been watching , but she never mentioned Gretel 's failure . In fact , if Gretel remembers correctly , Jill was the one to turn away . Who will watch her now and not fault her for falling ? Whom will she call in the middle of the night ? Who will place her baby back in the cradle , then take the phone into the cellar , where there is at least some privacy ? Who will talk until there 's nothing more to say ? Gretel gets out of bed in the dark , silent and careful not to wake Leonardo . She pulls on some shorts , tucks in her T-shirt , and makes her way through the house , navigating with one hand on the wall . When she gets out to the yard , she can see her old house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ivy . There is her bedroom window . There is the front door . There are the roses , whose scent carries in the thick night air . It is no surprise to find Jill out on the steps , drinking a cold beer . Jill always had trouble sleeping . Some people said it was a complete and total waste when Jill got pregnant and dropped out of school , and if truth be told , Gretel was one of them . Now she 's not so sure . " Bad dream ? " Jill asks . As a girl , Gretel was prone to nightmares , but that is n't the case anymore . Now she 's simply a nervous wreck , like most human beings in the world . " It 's too hot , " she says . If this were Gretel 's last night on earth , she would want the moonlight to be like this , spilling out over the lawns . " Too hot to handle , " Jill says . In the moonlight , she looks as young as ever . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I was the pretty one , you were the smart one . " " Screw you , " Gretel says . " I was the pretty one . " Jill starts to laugh at that . " Sorry , " she says when Gretel shoots her look . " I love you anyway . Even if you 're smart . " They walk around to the front of the house , barefoot , and although Jill has finished her beer , Gretel brings hers along . They 're both tired , but the night is so hot , and by now they know they 'll never get to sleep . Gretel has to leave for the airport at 5:30 A.M. , so she may as well stay awake and catch a nap on the plane . Tomorrow , she and Jill will cry beside the boarding gate , but now they 're sharing Gretel 's beer and taking their time , walking slowly , like tourists , through a landscape they know inside out . The streetlights cast a hazy glow , the light of a dream you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the lawns . " This is the place where the two girls died . " Jill points across the street to a house that looks exactly like all the rest . " They killed themselves in the garage . " " Yikes . " Gretel wishes now that she 'd worn shoes . The cement retains heat ; if anything , it seems to get hotter at night . " What a way to go . " " They made a secret pact , " Jill says . " Their lives were screwed up . Boy problems . Family problems . The same old shit we had . " Jill sounds calm , but her face looks funny . If she were anyone else , Gretel would swear she was about to cry . " Stupid girls . " Jill shakes her head . " They should have just waited . That 's all they had to do . They would have grown up , and everything would have been all right . " " I 'm glad we waited , " Gretel says . They stare at the garage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parked in it now , and the door is locked just in case any kids get it into their heads that they want a souvenir . But there has n't been a news story about the incident in days , not even in the town paper , and over at the high school , most people have dropped the subject completely . It 's only Jill who still comes here , and after tonight , even she wo n't come back . She 's glad that tonight is so beautiful . The air is mild and wraps around you ; it 's sweet when you breathe in and when you breathe out . " Hey , " Gretel says . She holds out her arm to show Jill that a firefly has landed on her skin . It blinks a pale yellow light-an SOS . A signal to the soul . " Should we kill it ? " Jill says . They laugh like crazy at that . Two crazy girls on the sidewalk in the middle of a June night when everyone else in the neighborhood is safe in bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it rises so high , it 's impossible to tell where it is among the stars . " It decided to live , " Gretel says . Some things , after all , are as simple as that . " Well , good for it . " Jill breathes in deeply . She stares up through the trees , even though she knows she 'll never see that firefly again . " Good for us , " she says . 
##1003630 Since that unlucky day in Dallas , JFK 's life had been a little sedentary . The time had come to get his golf clubs back . Fiction by Robert Olen Butler <p> WHEN WE TURNED ONTO SEVENTYsecond Street and saw what awaited us , my handler flinched , and he tightened his grip on the wheel . I suspect he wanted to accelerate on by and abort the whole plan . But he knew the Director had okayed it and he looked at me . " Are you sure , Mr. President ? " he said . The only thing you could see of Sotheby 's was a white awning . The front of the building had completely disappeared behind television trucks and satellite dishes . It was a risk , of course . But things that Jackie and I had lived with were disappearing into the hands of strangers , and it made me feel as if I were dead . The CIA could get me in only on this third day , and I knew well enough already that the $4,000 I 'd been able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't allow me to buy back even a tie clip . But there were other things working on me . I had to go . We passed an NHK satellite truck beaming to Tokyo and then a BBC truck , and I said to my handler , " Let every nation know , whether it wishes us well or ill , that we shall pay any price . " " Mr. President ? " he said , pressing me to prove I was n't rambling . He was a very young man . " You probably never even read my inaugural address , " I said . He was reaching for his cellular phone . " Dave , you do n't have to call . I 'm just having a little joke . It 's all right . The Director and I talked it over . There 's no better place to hide than the glare . " Dave pulled his hand back to the steering wheel . " I 'm sorry , Mr. President . " " That 's okay , Dave . In case of domestic insurrection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house in Arlington , Virginia . " His hand went for the phone again . " Chill out , Dave . That was President Johnson 's plan . Old news . I said that on purpose as a joke . " " I respectfully request that you do n't joke like that , Mr. President . " My handler is right to be nervous . After all , loose talk is why I 'm in the position of having to sneak into the public auction of the effects of my late wife . It 's why my long-suffering Jackie was led to live , unaware , as a bigamist , the wife of a Greek who had a face that could stop a thousand ships . The bullets fired on that fateful afternoon in Dallas killed only the editor in my brain . After that moment , I could not hold my tongue about anything . I woke up on the gurney rolling into the hospital and began at once to disclose all the state secrets of that very secretive time . Of no use now . But it 's far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Agency determined quite quickly must never have even momentary access to me . I completely agreed with the decision . It 's only the editor that 's gone . My powers to reason are still completely intact , and this was the only reasonable course . Anyone who came near me would become a security risk . And of no import to the CIA but critical to me , I would have talked endlessly to Jackie about the things that we agreed would never be spoken . Along with the secret details of our foreign policy , the smells and sights and tastes of all the women I 'd ever known would come tumbling out . There was no choice but to bury the wax dummy in my place . Not only is my reason untouched , so are my powers to remember . Sweet memory . It 's been the great comfort of my confinement . Still , I 'm very glad now to be sliding to a stop in front of this white awning . I know I can meet my commitment to silence . I realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know is of no use . But I suspect that if I were to speak now of the doomsday rocket silo twenty miles north-northeast of Burgdorf , Idaho , in the Gospel Hump Wilderness , I would be speaking of something still in place , though perhaps the target agenda of Moscow , Peking , Pyongyang , and Hanoi would have changed slightly . But I am determined to withhold even the faintest allusion to these things . As I pointed out to the Director , I never asked to go to the funerals or the weddings . I did n't ask to go to Teddy when he left that girl in the dark water at Chappaquiddick or to my nephew , who never even had a chance to know me , when it was clear to me that he needed to speak honestly of what he 'd done to that girl in Florida . I did n't even ask to go to John-John to warn him about the magazine business . But this auction was a different thing . I step out of the car . I suspect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of sight . But for a moment I feel alive again . I feel that I am living in my body , in the present moment . How sweet that is , I 've come to realize in these thirty-two years of exile . How often in the life I used to lead was I in a place that could have filled me with memories , but my mind carried me elsewhere . I missed the moment . Now , on the sidewalk in front of Sotheby 's , I head to the end of a long line of people whose faces once would have turned to me , whose hands would have come out to touch me . It took me a long time to get used to that touching . I never quite did . But I crave it now . They touch me now in my dreams . Hands trembling faintly from excitement , warm with the flush of desire . I touch them back , each one . But here , the TV lights glare and the crowds line up and they yearn to touch only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to what Abraham Lincoln dreamed the week before he was killed . He dreamed that he awoke from a deep sleep and he heard distant sobbing . He arose and made his way through the empty hallways of the White House to the East Room , where he found a great catafalque draped in black . A military guard stood there and Lincoln asked , " Who is dead ? " The man replied , " It is the President . " I could ask anyone now in this line , " Whose French silver-plated toothbrush box with cover is this , being auctioned off to strangers ? " And the reply would be , " It is the President 's . " I PASS ALL THESE HANDS STUFFED IN POCKETS OR CLUTCHing purses or fluttering in conversation . I pass all these faces turned away from this bearded man with close-cropped hair and the faint line of a scar on the side of his skull and the hobble of a very bad back . And I know I should be glad that there is not the tiniest flicker of recognition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's stuck his neck out for me . Pity for an old man and his past . Trust that old age has slowed my tongue , which it has , somewhat . But part of me is ready to tell , at the slightest glance from a stranger , how Mayor Richard Daley found fourteen thousand votes in the cemeteries of Chicago to swing a state and elect a president . And I would point out the debt of gratitude the whole planet owes those dead voters . None of us knew at the time of the missile crisis of 1962 that the Soviet general in charge of troops in Cuba was authorized to use tactical nuclear weapons . After the Soviet Union broke up , the general appeared on TVI get all the cable channels-and he said if the American President had chosen to send troops to the island , they would have been nuked . If Richard Nixon had been the President , he certainly would have sent those troops . What does this mean ? It means those dead Chicagoans prevented a nuclear holocaust . My impulse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given to this necropolis of American heroes . But no stranger gives me a glance . I go to the end of the line and my back is hurting , but out here in public , the pain reassures me somehow . A woman up ahead in the line turns her face idly toward me . She has hair . the color of the old Red Grange model football we used in Hyannis the autumn I made love , on the overstuffed chair in my Senate office , to a woman who was all bones and freckles and teeth , and her thick hair was the same color , a roan color , and she sat on my lap and thrashed her hair around me . She has spent time with me often these past years , in my memory . And this woman in line turns her eyes briefly to me and then her attention passes on . She is perhaps thirty-five . In my memory I am thirty-five , but this woman before me now sees only an old man . But I 'm still sitting on that overstuffed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweating and smelling the woman 's hair and I tell her about its color , the color of a Red Grange football , and she laughs . The woman in line laughs now . She is with someone near her , but I do n't look to see who it is . I watch her face dilate sweetly in laughter and if she were standing next to me , I know I would speak to her of this other woman , whose name I ca n't remember and whose eyes I ca n't remember , though I 've often tried in these years of exile . I would like to remember her eyes , because remembering these other things as vividly as I do makes me feel as if the memory of her eyes should be there , too , but it got put aside and then sold off or given away and it was a big mistake . I want it back . Photograph <p> I want my Harvard-crest cuff links back , too . I 'm thinking of them as I finally make it through the front door of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holds out her hand to help me through the metal detector . I would not call her a Negro to her face-I know the language has changed-but I am still a creature of my time and Martin called himself that . I will always remember where I was on the day Martin was shot . I was in the little stone-walled garden in the cottage in the compound in Virginia . I was about to launch a putt across the fifteen-foot green whose one hole has pulled me to it ten thousand times a year for all these years . I was just aligning the head of my putter-I want my old putter back , too , by the way , though it 's sure to draw a small fortune-I was just squaring up the head of my putter when whatever aide it was assigned to me at that time-I do n't remember him except that he was youngstepped out of the back door and he said , " Mr. President " with a rasp in his throat and I knew that it was something terrible . Poor Martin . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been shot away and they thought to bring him to me . We could have told each other so many things we never had sense enough to talk about when we were living our public lives . And Bobby , too . We three could live together and I 'd talk with Martin and I 'd wrestle my little brother to the ground-even with my back-and with his editor shot off Bobby could tell me what he really thinks of me , and that would do him good . So this young Negro woman reaches out to the old man she sees in front of her , an old man having trouble straightening up , having just gone up some steps with a very bad back , and her hand clutches me beneath my forearm . And though there are two sleeves between me and her flesh , I thrill at her touch . I straighten up , not wanting her to be touching the arm of a stooping old man , and there must be pain but I do n't feel it . She looks me in the eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is some flicker of recognition there . " Do you know me ? " I ask . " No , sir , " she says . I realize I 'm on the verge of telling her about the perfect hit man we 'd hired to kill Fidel Castro in 1963 . Pedro Antonelli . I do n't know why I think she 'd be interested in this . But I know I 'm not supposed to say anything . So I step through the arch of the metal detector , and the machine cries out as if it had seen a ghost . The woman who touched my arm is beside me and I 'm ready to confess . But before I can speak , she says , " Do you have anything metal , sir ? " and I understand . I tap the side of my head , on the tight ridge of scar tissue , and I say , " Metal plate . From service for my country . " I think she can hear the ring of it beneath my knuckle . " I 'm sorry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she will reach up to touch the place herself . But her hand goes to my arm again and urges me toward a desk . " Thank you , " she says . " Show your registration slip over there . " I move away from her and there is still a ringing in my head and at the desk they give me my bidding card , and from the push of people behind me I 'm going up more steps , made of stone , and my back is hurting again and I 'm growing older by the moment , though I can still feel her touch on my arm . The Director has not been very good in recognizing my desires as a man . I 've always understood the risks . There were n't very many women with the highest Agency clearances who were prepared to open themselves to me . One or two over the years . And there was always a drug to slow my tongue , because even the highest clearance is still bound tight by the need-to-know test . I presume the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my awareness was , for I remember these women only very faintly . I wish there had been another way , a safer way , a fully conscious way , for me to feel the touch of a woman . But I did not ask what more they could do for me . I only asked what I could do for my country . The room is very large and I struggle toward the front , but the rows of padded beige chairs are filled more than halfway back already . I look around and I straighten again , this time with clear pain , but a pain put aside . I see Jackie down the row . She has not yet sat down . She has a pillbox hat and that stiff bouffant hairdo . But I remind myself that she could n't be that young . And she 's dead . I look again . Her eyes-she is smoothing her hot-pink dress and looking around the room-her eyes are Asian . Her gaze fixes and hardens and I follow it and coming down the aisle is another Jackie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still of her rival . I sit . I am on the aisle and breathing heavily . I suspect there are several of me in the room as well , though I hope not to catch even a brief sight of them . I ca n't help but look up , and the second Jackie , with a slightly longer hairdo , twirled up at the bottom , brushes past me . Her face turns and her eyes fall and she looks straight at me . She does n't show any sign at all of sensing who I am . As false as she isher eyes are much too close together and her mouth is too thin-I 'm briefly disappointed that she does n't recognize me . I look away and I close my eyes . Jackie has been with me , as well , all these years . When John and Caroline were sleeping in the afternoons , I 'd clear half an hour in the affairs of state and tell my staff to leave us alone , and Jackie and I would make love in the room where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I 'd ask her to talk to me about art while we touched . I wanted her mind in this act , and her voice , breathy as a starlet . I 've been slandered over and over in the books . Smathers was way out of line telling those things about our Senate bachelor days . I might 've talked like that about women with him-men have always talked stupidly about women with each other . And it 's true that my mind was often elsewhere when I touched the women who always seemed to be there , open to me . But not because I did n't value them . Not because they were objects to me , taken up and cast off even more coldly than the objects for sale in this crowded room . There are suddenly too many things in my head at once . This happens sometimes . The voice of a woman now . " New bidder on my right at sixty thousand . " I do n't know what it is that 's for sale but I have only four thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason I ca n't quite identify . Jackie would rise naked above me as I lay delicately still , trying not to let my back distract me . She would rise into a column of sunlight from the window and her skin was dusky and her voice was soft and she would be wearing a single strand of pearls , the only thing left on her body , and she would speak of the geometry of Attic pottery in the tenth century B.C. , and the bands of decoration were drawn in black on creamcolored clay and there would be meanders and chevrons and swastikas and then , gradually , as the ninth century B.C. passed and the eighth began , there was an advent of animal forms . She spoke of all these wonderful vessels : the amphora with its two great handles and the krater with its fat belly and wide mouth and the skinny lecythus for pouring . Jackie would throw her head back and her mind would make my breath catch and now the eighth century B.C. was in full flower with horsemen and chariots and battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and women lamenting the dead , and her eyes would tear up , even as we touched and she fell forward and I put my hands on her back and felt her bones . " No , ma'am , it 's not your bid . " A long , sweetly handsome face , a Boston sort of face , to my eye , is floating over the lectern at the front of the room , rolling out numbers . " It 's at a hundred and ten on the phone . Now a hundred and twenty in the front . Yes , ma'am , now it 's yours , at a hundred and thirty . A hundred and thirty thousand dollars . A hundred and forty at the back of the room . " I look away from her and I think for a moment that it must be a Grecian krater for sale , something I 'd always hoped Onassis would buy for her but that she would never speak of with him , but on a TV monitor to the side of the room I see a triple strand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now sixty and I squeeze my eyes shut . Jackie crosses the White House bedroom to me , her clothes strewn behind her and the pearls tight at her throat , and they make her nakedness astonishing to me , as if no woman has ever been this naked before , and it takes the contrast , the failed covering of the thin string of pearls , to show me this . The room has burst into applause . I look up . And the second Jackie , her eyes too close together but rather large , very dark , is looking at me . She is in the aisle seat directly across from me and she is looking at me intently " Now lot number 454A , " the woman at the front says . This Jackie in blue wo n't look away . She knows me . She knows . " A single-strand simulated-pearl necklace and ear clips . " I drag my attention away from the simulated Jackie 's gaze and on the TV screen is the necklace my wife wears in my memory of our lovemaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necklace . She wore a single strand of pearls at our wedding , too . When Jackie wore pearls , I felt her nakedness always , even beneath her clothes . I stare at this necklace on the television screen and it could well be the pearls of any of a hundred memories I 've taken out and handled on countless nights of what has been my life . I feel myself rise up slightly , briefly , from my chair . I hold back my hands , which want to lift to the screen , to this image of her pearls . I want these pearls very badly . " The opening bid is ten thousand dollars , " the woman with the long face says . I cry out . My cry is in anguish , but there are twenty cries at the same moment and they are all saying , " Ten thousand . " So no one hears . Except perhaps the Jackie across the aisle . This necklace is beyond my reach already . All the fragments of my life in this place are beyond my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed on me , this thin-lipped faux First Lady . Her mouth moves . I stand up , I turn , I drop my bidding card and push my heavy legs forward , the pain in my back flaring at each step . Twenty thousand . Thirty . The bidders " hands fly up , flashing their cards , the dollars pursue me up the aisle . Forty thousand from the phones . Fifty from the front row . I touch her there , at the hollow of her throat just below the pearls . Jackie rises up straight , nestled naked on the center of me , and I lift my hand and put my fingertips on the hollow of her throat . And I am out the main door of the auction room , breaking through a hedge of reporters who pay no attention to me . I stop , my chest heaving and the pain spreading all through me , and I look over my shoulder and just before the reporters close back up , I see her . She 's coming toward me . The Jackie in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newsmen intervene but I know she will soon be here . Now I wish for the Director 's men . I want their hands to take my elbows and I want them to whisper , This way , Mr. President , and I want them to carry me away , back to the empty garden and a patch of sunlight where I can just sit and sort out the strange things going on inside me . But I am on my own , it seems . The main staircase is before me , but there are more reporters that way and the faux Jackie will catch me just in time for them . I turn blindly to the right , I go along a corridor , my face lowered , trying to disappear , and another staircase is before me , a modest one , linoleum , a metal handrail . My hand goes out to it , I take one step down and her voice is in my ear . " Please , " she says . I stop . " I recognized you , " she says . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drive you away . Her eyes are very beautiful . The brown of them , like the earth in the deepest hole you could dig for yourself , like a place to bury yourself and sleep forever , is like the brown of Jackie 's eyes . I want to tell her secrets . About myself . About missile silos . About anything . All the secrets I know . " I thought I read somewhere you were dead , " she says . She sounds charmingly ironic to me . But there is something about her eyes now , a little unfocused . And she is dressed as my wife , who is dead . " I did n't believe it , " she says . " Good , " I say , struggling with my voice , which wants to speak much more . Then she says , " I 've seen all your movies . " There is a stopping in me . " The Grapes of Wrath is my favorite . " " Thank you , " I say . " Hurry back to the auction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She tilts her head at the intensity of my advice . I turn away from her , move myself down the steps . " Yes , " she calls after me . " I will . " I am out the side entrance now , on York Avenue . It is quieter here . No one looks at me . I am a ghost again . I turn and walk away , I do n't know in what direction . But this I do know : I love Jackie . I know because inside me I have her hands and her hair and her nipples and her toes and her bony elbows and knees and her shoes and belts and scarves and her shadow and her laugh and her moans and her simulated-pearl necklaces and her yellow gypsy bangle bracelets and her Gorham silver heart-shaped candy dish and her silver-plated salt and pepper shakers . And somebody has my golf clubs . And somebody has my cigar humidor . And somebody has my Harvard-crest cuff links . And somebody has a single strand of Jackie 's pearls , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about all these things of a person that wo n't fade away ? The things you seek out over and over and you look at intently and you touch . You touch with your own hands . Or you touch with the silent movement of your mind in the long and solitary night . Surely these things are signs of love . In a world where we do n't know how to stay close to each other , we try to stay close to these things . In a world where death comes unexpectedly and terrifies us as the ultimate act of forgetting , we try to remember so that we can overcome death . And so we go forth together in love and in peace and in deep fear , my fellow Americans , Jackie and I and all of you . And you have my undying thanks . 
##1003631 Did I tell you she was raped ? <p> And not by the man she stabbed ? <p> If you could do . . . something-I could n't remember what-then you 'd be able to do something else . I could n't remember that , either . I knew it was the poem they quote at commencements and at civic-awards ceremonies in small upstate communities like mine . I remembered the rhythm of its lines , but I could n't remember the words . <p> My head was a hive of halfremembered words , tatters of statement , halves of stories , the litter of alibis , confessions , supplications and demands , the aftereffects , perhaps , of the time I spent standing beside my grown , or half-grown , ungrown , ingrown child in a courtroom . She trembled , and I tried to situate myself , standing as we were before the clerks ' desk , which was before and below the bench of the judge , so that she could lean her thin , shivering body on mine , at least a shoulder or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heft of my hand against the hard , cold , bony fingers of hers . But she would not accept the heat of my flesh or the weight I wished she might prop herself on . The trial for the crime had never taken place , because our lawyer convinced us-Alec , my daughter , and me-that she should plead nolo contendere : guilty , in a word . She had , as they say , copped a plea . She 'd bargained down . She and the victim and the Manhattan district attorney 's office had agreed to change the shape of events . We would say that Alec did not incise three small cuts in the skin of Victor Petrekis 's face with a stainless-steel pocket knife brought to her from England by her father when she was small . She and our lawyer , Petrekis and the assistant district attorney , had constructed a language to make her crime the attempt of the deed she had in fact done . And we were before the judge to hear the sentence he would pass . <p> Petrekis and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge 's right . The two clerks periodically bent to write on forms . The marshals behind us , their belts creaking with the weight of their guns , their lapel radios hissing static , waited to learn if they would take her to jail . I had been warned that they put your child in handcuffs right there , as she stands beside you , and they take her off . The heavier clerk , her face a kind of mild mask , was the one who swore us in , ending her question-whether we would tell the truth before this court-with the warning that we must remember how on that great day , when all would be judged , our falsehoods would be weighed against us . It seemed to me she expected us all to lie and was trying , with her impassivity , not to show her disappointment in our dishonesty . But we all said , and in unison , " I do , " as if the ceremony were about marriage and not the dissolution of whatever you might name-rest , comfort , household , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit she had bought for law school . It was too large , like everything she owned , and its eggplant color , once so interesting with her red-gold hair , now seemed to overpower her complexion . It made her look gray . Her hair was thin and muddy-looking , cropped so short I could see , from beside her , the bone of her skull behind her ear . Her head looked vulnerable to the temperature of the air , and of course to the world of cruel surfaces before which her head was naked now . Even the sleeves of the suit seemed too long , as if her body had diminished in length as well as breadth . <p> The judge had a wattle of chin and a thick , long nose . The flesh of his face was pitted and loose , his scalp very broad and shiny . But his eyes were of a rich , dark blue , and he spoke with an urgency , a sense of concern , in which I believed . He read from sentencing guidelines and asked the assistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they agreed with his understanding of the rules . The ADA , as Sylvia called him , nodded . Sylvia said , " Yes , Judge . " I found myself nodding , too , though of course I knew nothing . I knew nothing . <p> The knife was about three and a half inches long when folded shut . Its single blade was short and thin . Barry had gone to the north of England on a buying trip . He ordered printed cottons to be sold to dressmakers in the States , and he brought home cloth for me and a print of Stonehenge that he said was designed by Turner though etched and inked by someone else , and a little pocket knife for Alec , who was going through a boy phase that year and was pining for a left-handed first baseman 's mitt , an aluminum bat , and the kind of knife that guys carried in the pocket of their jeans . <p> She kept it in her purse during Barry 's dying , and through the end of college in the zipper pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law school it was in a compartment of Barry 's attache case in which she hauled her work between her apartment on 113th Street and the library and classrooms of Columbia Law . <p> Did I say that she was raped ? <p> The question 's rhetorical , of course : the ploy of a woman on a back porch alone , shielded from her neighbors by a waist-high wall , lighting cigarettes and blowing the smoke at mayflies surrounding her head in a cloud , thick as the words in court , as she tries to startle the black night or circumstance itself that hovers about her . She surely , on the other hand , was raped , and by a student she knew , and in the comfort and convenience of her own furnished apartment . He , too , had his time in court , he , too , pleaded guilty after first contesting her claim . He , too , was sentenced , and Alec stood at the left of the bar , the judge 's right , and said , once more , her grievance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they prepared together for a test , had wept , and so had she . She should have howled her rage , though I believe , and so do her doctors , that nothing would have prevented what they came to call the break . <p> He raped her because he loved her , because he detested her , because he was jealous of her grade in the course , or because , when he was little , it was just this side of possible , his lawyer had claimed at first , that he was abused by a man who led the Cub Scouts . Perhaps each possibility was true . It never mattered to me . I wanted him gelded . I wanted the wound sealed with boiling pitch , with concentrated lime , and bound with barbed wire . It did n't matter to Alec either , though she spoke at first about friendship , and she wondered whether she had led him on . She soon enough stopped . <p> She soon enough stopped calling home . She soon enough , when I was able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Soon , she mostly wept . And of course I should have gone at once , at the first hint of a sign of damage , to the city to rescue her . I should have stolen her . I should have fetched my baby home . But I waited , because I was leading my life , after all . I was teaching high school students how to distinguish between Babylon and Byzantium , Arafat and Attaturk , and I was failing , as were they , but that was how we were required to consume our days , and life was a storm of consequences with which one had to deal , and Alec in New York was only tense about her studies . <p> " It 's the work , Mommy , " she said . " I have too much of it . " <p> " Maybe it 's the wrong work . " <p> " You sound so Jewish , Mommy . " <p> " I think of you in New York , and I remember myself in New York , and I sound city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " You 're in the foothills of Harlem and you can say that ? " <p> " I 'm in the foothills of fuck up . " <p> " Alec . " <p> " Got ta go . Got ta go . I 'm doing permutations of collateral estoppel , and I ca n't stop . " <p> " Al , I think maybe you ought to stop . " <p> " Bill till you drop . Do n't stop . ' Bye , Mommy . " <p> " Feel good and be careful ? Please ? Oh , say hello to Coriander , " I said , but she 'd hung up . <p> Barry and I had lived together in New York for the first few years of our marriage . He was a student at Cooper Union , and I was a dancer , and it 's like watching a balloon that leaks while it zips in circles over your head , but in very slow motion , to see how those ambitions were mostly wishes and breath . But we were there when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married day , in the room-plus-bathroom that we described as almost on University Place , I woke up next to my tall , hairy husband with his elegant , long , slender feet , and I did n't know which hunger banged from inside at my ribs-need for food , or need for Barry . Food won , but we had n't very much . There were crackers and a wad of multipurpose processed cheese on the table seven feet from our bed . But there was a cake , prepared on upper Broadway to the specifications of Barry 's mother , and I was assailed by a need for sweets , and the cake was , for reasons we could n't ever remember , on the little square table from The Workbench that Barry 's best man had given us . So I reached out and plucked the three- or four-inch-high couple , made of sugar in black and white , the bride in her broad white gown , the groom in his morning coat and striped trousers , each with a genderless face of white with periods under black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I bit-without planning to , and never knowing what I 'd meant to signify-at the head of the little groom . <p> That was how we came to spend our first married afternoon in the office of a dentist named Echaissy on Eighth Street , because the darling couple were made of plaster , and I had cracked a tooth . The groom suffered only a chip to his glossy pompadour . We carried them with us to our next apartment , on Seventeenth Street , and then to Mamaroneck , and then upstate , where Barry took over a factory and I took over a classroom , and where Barry 's lungs filled with fibers of cloth , and his body devoured itself . We were married in City Hall , our witnesses had no camera , and the imperfect painted plaster couple are the embodiment and souvenir of what Barry and I and two witnesses had seen . We kept the bride and groom on a bookshelf in our living room , and there they remain , less the same of course , but standing watch over what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'd given a stuffed tan cat with which Alec had slept since her second or third year . Barry told her stories about Coriander , and the saga had become the subject of Alec 's first and only novel , three sheets of paper stapled together , all six sides bearing crayon drawings of adventures about which she had written in thick , tall capitals . I remember one " Aha ! " in messy blue letters , and I remember Barry crooning it to Alec months earlier , one weekend night at bedtime . " Aha ! " he 'd called , " Aha ! " she 'd echoed , on a Sunday night when , to keep the next morning 's class from arriving unmediated , and to demonstrate what I could not adequately say about that father and his child connected by the victorious shout of a make-believe cat , I had seduced him on a little armless rocking chair , outside on our porch , hidden from our neighbors by the porch 's waist-high wall . Coriander had been washed , mended , tossed and mauled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in each of Alec 's dormitory rooms , and she had continued to be resident childhood fetish in Alec 's place on Broadway and 113th . That was where I went after Alec called to wish me happy birthday . <p> " Darling , " I said . " Al . " <p> " What , Mommy ? " <p> " Al , it is n't my birthday . " <p> " Sure it is . Today 's the eleventh , dingbat . " <p> I did n't know what else to say : " But that 's Daddy 's birthday , remember ? It is n't mine for a month , I 'm afraid . " <p> " It is n't ? " <p> " No . " <p> " It 's Daddy 's birthday ? Today ? But it ca n't be his birthday . He 's dead . " <p> " Yes , " I said . " Where are you , honey ? Are you home ? " <p> " What difference could that make ? When am I is more like it . God . Daddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . When 's mine ? " <p> " Your birthday ? Alec , are you in your apartment ? " <p> " Yes . I 'm here in the kitchen thing . Ette . Kitchenette . I was looking at the ingredients and everything in the cupboard to see if I could make you a cake , you know , or something , but of course that would be so stupid . I ca n't bake at all , as we both know perfectly well . And the cake I 'd have to ca n't bake would have to be for Daddy , not you , and he 's dead . You are n't , right ? No . I really meant to ask : Am I ? " <p> " Dead , Al ? " <p> She said , very breezily , " What 's your best bet ? " Then all I heard was the sound of stoppered crying , someone 's mouth and nose cupped shut while they tried not to weep and they failed . <p> I said , " Al . " <p> " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm strong enough anymore , Mommy . I do n't think I can do this anymore . " <p> " No , " I said , " I 'm leaving now . I 'm coming . Promise me to stay in your apartment . Can you call someone ? " <p> " Sure . What should I call them ? " She laughed while she cried . <p> " Get some friends over , Al . Anyone you trust . " <p> " Well , he 's in jail for raping me , actually . " <p> " Someone else . " <p> " He 's the one who wo n't see me anymore . <p> " I do n't think I know who you mean . " <p> " Obviously , a man I saw and I do n't see him because he refuses to see me . " <p> " Is he a-friend ? " <p> " Lover . " <p> " Ah . " <p> " Do n't ' ah ' me , Mommy , all right ? I 'm old enough to have a lover . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't remember- " <p> " No , " she said . " I never talked about him . We did n't last long enough for me to find a short enough word that could describe how lousy it got so fast . A woman is allowed to want a man at the just about end of the twentieth century , may I point out . I keep waiting for a kind of sign or something , but he will not stand up for me . He is n't what you 'd call a stand-up guy . I tried telling him that . Because someone will punish him . Someone , of course , is going to demonstrate how you 're either a stand-up guy-a man , you know ? the genuine article , or you 're hollow . If you 're a dummy , I said , do n't come around here . But I did n't know he 'd do what I said to do or not to do . It 's pretty clear-cut , though , you know ? You 'd know . You got around a little when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you stick a pin in his balloon , right ? His name is Victor Petrekis . He 's Greek . He 's what you would call a classical piece of ass , but hollow . Like those statues they make of the real statues , not in the museum . He ca n't be there when I need him to be . You know , when it 's tough . It 's very tough , Mommy . " <p> It took me four hours to drive to Manhattan . I double-parked on 113th , and at a very sloppy angle , effectively sealing off the street , I later saw . She sat on the floor , leaning against a wall . The telephone was on the floor beside her . Her legs were crossed at the ankle , and her arms were folded on her chest . She looked as if she were sleeping , but then her eyes opened undramatically , and she said , " How was the drive ? " We took her purse and Barry 's attache case filled with law books , I grabbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she put some clothing in a bag with a carrying strap . She moved slowly , as if her joints were very sore . She was pale and skinny and vacant of expression . Then she seemed to grow angry with me for having come , angry at my insisting she leave . <p> " Do n't blame me if I flunk out , " she said , walking down the single flight in front of me . Her bag rasped along the wall of the staircase , and the case clunked on the wroughtiron banister . " They do n't make excuses here , understand ? A little fruitcake is not an excuse , and anyway no one makes them . Ca n't you just leave me alone ? " <p> We emerged to the sound of eight kinds of car horn . I set the baggage on the back seat , fastened her belt as if she were very little or very old , and I think that she was both , and I drove us away , pursued by the outraged driver of a Yellow cab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Washington Bridge when I thought to say , " Alec ? Have you got Coriander ? " <p> " Oh , for Christ 's sake , Mommy ! Ca n't you think of something else besides a doll ? " <p> " But have you got her ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> We saw a psychologist in the area , and she was worried . She said the word I expected , " depression . " She used another word , " psychotic , " and I chewed at the inside of my cheek to keep from crying . She referred Alec to a psychiatrist , who referred her to another one , in Cooperstown , and this one , a tall man whose hair was almost the color of Alec 's hair , convinced her to be signed into the psychiatric center . He used the word " medicate , " and he said " stabilize . " Alec used the word " okay , " but I could n't find one . <p> Then Alec used the word " no , " and we went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me , and we struck an agreement : I would bring Alec the next morning to the psychiatric unit of the Imogene Bassett Hospital in Cooperstown , New York , and she would receive " medication " and " stability " and " tests . " Alec slept the rest of that day . I did n't . I looked at photographs in our albums , avoiding Barry 's face when I could because I missed him when I saw him because when I looked up from the pictures I could never see him again unless I once again looked down . I was trying to find , in photos of Alec as an infant and child and young adult , a clue , in the droop of an eyelid or the tone of her skin , to what all these new words- " depression , " " psychosis , " " medication " were about . I saw how often in her pictures she looked serious , or worried , or alert as if to a threat . <p> So we ought to have known , right ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd said , " No , ma'am . No . Forget any words like ' should ' and ought . ' I have astonishing news for you . I want you to memorize what I say . You did not cause this disease andyou ready ? -you ca n't cure it . Did n't cause , ca n't cure . Hug her when she lets you , and do n't get mad at her . It is n't her fault , either . Well , you will get mad , but try and not show it . " <p> I said , " But how can you have a problem and it is n't someone 's fault . " <p> He laughed . " I 'm Jewish , too , " he said , " but you can get used to it . No-fault disease . " <p> I made coffee in the early morning , put the photo albums away , found my stomach too upset for coffee , and went upstairs to wake Alec for the drive to Cooperstown . She sat on her bed , her back against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had just been rescued from a wreck at sea . Her face looked almost yellow , and the shadows under her eyes looked brown . She had n't slept a lot of the night . She had wakened and , sitting before the mirror on her dressing table , she had cut off her hair . It lay on the floor around her chair . She had given herself a crew cut . <p> " Interesting hair , " I said . <p> " Hair today , " she answered , " gone tomorrow . It 's tomorrow . " <p> " We need to leave as soon as you shower , " I said . <p> " I 'm not going . " Her eyes were dark with anger . Looking into them was like looking into the upstairs window of a high , old house . Someone , you suddenly realize with fright , is looking out of the window at you , and their expression has to do with disgust and with mockery . <p> I tried to say it to myself : I did n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgot the doctor 's words . <p> " Sure , Alec . Yes . Absolutely . We have to go . " <p> " Why do we have to go ? " <p> " So you can get better . " <p> " Better , " she said . <p> " It 's your life , Al . You need to do this . " <p> " Need , " she said . <p> " Al . " I remembered his injunction against anger . I thought : Hey , you use your tranquillity when it 's your kid . " Goddamn it , Alec . This is for your health . " <p> She said , as I knew she would , " Health . " <p> Then I realized what I had seen . I went to her dressing table and got down on my hands and knees . Coriander lay among the long , looped shafts and shorter curls of hair , and she lay down there in two pieces . Using her shears , Alec had severed the stuffed head from its stuffed body . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible face appeared in the window and looked down the length of the room to me . <p> " Oh , Alec , " I said . <p> She said , " Oh , Mommy . It 's only a household pet . " <p> The doctor had given me one more set of instructions , and I remembered them quite well . <p> I said , " I 'm going to call the state police . They 'll force you to the hospital , Alec . It 'll , I do n't know , go on your record . You 'll be a lawyer with a note on your record : State Police , ' it 'll say . " <p> " They ca n't , " she said , " and do n't pretend they can . You think you can put the whammy over on a law student ? And what record , you Jewmother jerk . " <p> " I 'm going to tell them I feel threatened . They 'll do it . " <p> " Threatened , " she said . " Only if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or if you 're named Petrekis . " <p> " What about him ? " <p> " You heard me . " <p> " Alec , did you do something to Petrekis ? " <p> " Who ? " <p> " To punish him ? " <p> " For hit-and-run foreplay ? It is a punishable offense . For hit-and-run soixante-neuf compunded by simply yet absolutely Not . Being . A. Stand . Up . Guy . " <p> " Alec , what ? What happened ? " <p> " When ? " <p> " Okay . I 'm calling the police . Have a happy morning . " I went to the foot of the stairs and found the number in the phone book and dialed it . My hand was shaking , and my voice , when I spoke to a woman who called herself sergeant something , wobbled and wavered . I said , " I 'm calling from outside of . . . No , it 's really in the township . . . Hell . I 'm a little nervous . Sorry . " Take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right , etc . And I was saying , " My daughter has had what I guess you 'd call a nervous breakdown . I need to .. . " <p> Alec walked downstairs , wearing flannel pajama bottoms , a dirty white T-shirt , and slippers without socks . She shook a blanket out like a cape and wrapped it around her shoulders . She went around the corner into the living room , and I heard noises but closed my eyes and took a breath so I could tell the sergeant what I needed . <p> Alec reappeared . She was redfaced , and I was grateful for any relief of her pallor , even though she was the color of her anger at me . <p> " Whore , " she said . " Candy-assed Jew whore and your pimp doctor cop friends . " <p> She walked past me and out the back door . <p> " A second , " I said to the sergeant . <p> I heard my car door slam . <p> " I 'm sorry , " I said , swallowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think it might be all right . I 'll call you back if there 's a problem . Thank you . I 'm very sorry for this . " <p> I did n't and I ca n't . <p> I took a jacket and keys and my wallet and went outside to drive her to the hospital . That was where they finally came , a couple of days later , when I was in the visitors ' lounge , taking a break from Alec 's complaints and her anger at what she called my betrayal . It was a new word to hear from Alec about myself , and I was chewing on it , really tasting its possibilities for me . A man in a wrinkled gray uniform was directed to me in the washed-out light of the beige waiting room , and he presented me with what he called a bench warrant-I had never heard the words-for Alec 's arrest , sworn out by a magistrate in Manhattan because she had fled the county to avoid prosecution for stabbing Victor Petrekis in the face . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who served the warrant . The warrant used the following words : " felonious " and " assault . " Neither it nor the deputy conveyed the information that the weapon was the small stainless pocket knife imported by the assailant 's father and given to her so she could be , for a little while , one of the fellows . The deputy left , and then I left . I needed to talk to lawyers , and Alec did not need to deal with one more fact served up by the world . <p> At home , I spent about an hour making chicken salad for a sandwich . I had no bread in the house , so I spent a while longer defrosting some rolls , then slicing and toasting one . I made myself a big sandwich with lots of lettuce , and I carried it into the living room . I wanted to sit with a book and find some language that would do me some good . 1 drifted along the shelves looking at titles , soon enough coming to the conclusion that I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book . I looked at a stack of CDs . I did n't want music either . I wanted silence , sleep , and somebody , when I woke up , who would manage the claims for health insurance , the bills from the landlord in New York , the conversation with the lawyer I would have to hire to represent Alec in court . <p> I realized that I was staring not at dust jackets but at the objects in front of them : the bride and groom , who had more or less outlasted Barry and me , despite the nick I 'd left on the head of the groom , and who had served to demonstrate , Barry liked to say , how dangerous my appetites had always been . When he spoke about sex , he would leer , I told him , like a peasant in the countryside . And he was pleased to serve as the local life force . <p> I said , " Barry ! " <p> Their heads were off . She had battered them against the edge of the shelf . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to me then : the poem they recite at you during graduations and the presentation of trophies to injured athletes . It was about how if you could keep your head while all about you were losing theirs and blaming it on you , you 'd own the world . <p> I saw that each figure had a metal rod around which it was molded , so the little couple would probably not crumble further , and would stand , adhering to their little skeletons , for as long as I left them on the shelf . I chewed at my chicken salad sandwich , looking back into their faceless stare . <p> I let myself pretend that Barry would walk into the living room then and ask me what I was doing . <p> I let myself pretend I would answer . <p> " Owning the world , " I would say around a mouthful of sandwich . <p> Author Affiliation 
##1003632 The Ivy League is a short haircut . The sides and back are buzzed , and the top is just long enough to comb . It makes Kenny look like the boy in the school portraits his mother props on the mantle . Also like some California surfer our friend Missy fell in love with . <p> Lately , Kenny 's been going for haircuts every Saturday , and I 've been keeping him company . Soon we 'll hear from colleges , and Kenny 's hoping these haircuts will bring him luck . He 's also hoping to play ball next year , and so Saturdays after the barber , we always look to hoop . Kenny can play-he practices-but he still ca n't make the high school varsity . He 's just not the complete package that some kids are . Because no matter how good he gets , he 's got no hops , and already that 's a skill you need to play on the team . <p> We checked the Northwestern courts-locked . The church gym-closed for Christmas . And I would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many busters there wanted to kill him . <p> We pounded on the emergency door at the Y until someone snuck us in . Games were running full . We recognized a big guy from our school named Charles Wormfeld , the type of cocky guy Kenny 's always looking to beat . <p> Of course the trouble with Charles starts straight off . It starts because Charles is a hack , and Kenny keeps calling him " Charles the Worm Worm Wormfeld , " and taking the ball to the hole . So first time Charles swats Kenny 's shot , Charles goes , " Get that shit out of here , " and pounds his hairy chest like the ape that he is . Kenny glares up . " Do n't do that , " he says quietly . " Not if you 're going to foul me every other time . Do n't talk smack , too . " <p> " So what are you going to do if I do , little man ? " Charles says , and that 's when the oglers circle up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairs . I yell , " Come on , Kenny , time to go . " But Kenny does n't answer . Already he 's got his arms spread , palms open , face right in Charles 's face . Then Kenny smiles and shakes his head . Charles thinks that 's it then , because he smiles and shakes his head , too , which is exactly when Kenny drops him-opens that can of whoop ass-and down Charles goes . <p> I do n't know if any of the other guys are Charles 's friends , but I throw the chair , anyway , just in case . People will clear off when you throw a chair , and it was getting so this was our routine : Kenny going wild , me throwing something big to get him out of there . <p> We jumped in Kenny 's mom 's black Beemer , and I was screaming , " The fuck are you doing ? Always fucking shit up . " <p> Kenny had us in drive and was looking seriously apologetic , swerving through the parking lot to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm sorry . He just pissed me off . I get so mad . " And on the steering wheel I could see his knuckles laid out and flexing , the splits above his middle two fingers opening and closing like little pink fish mouths . <p> Two blocks later , Kenny broke left . <p> " It 's his house over here , right ? " <p> " Whose house ? " <p> " Charles the Worm Worm Wormfeld 's . You know , right up here , right ? " <p> " Oh , man , Kenny , I do n't know . " <p> Kenny pulled in behind a garage with a hoop above the door . How he knew this was Charles 's , I had no idea . <p> " Now just be cool now , " Kenny said , and he dug the tire iron out from the trunk and balanced on the roof of the Beemer to pry Charles 's rim off . Two minutes later it was ours-that is , Charles 's pretty rim had ripped free-and we 're bombing north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the sunroof like a trophy . <p> Kenny 's basement is mostly cement , and it 's where his father used to see clients back in the 1970 's . Now that he 's set in his downtown office , it 's become Kenny 's unofficial bedroom , still sporting the black leather couch , orange carpet , and macrame wall hangings from when Kenny 's mom redecorated the upstairs den . Most of the stuff we 've somehow managed to break , or scorch , or in some way mar-there 's silver duct tape on nearly everything-but Mr. and Mrs. Sharf never snoop down here , and it 's funny because just above us , the Sharfs ' house is full of these really nice rooms where it always feels like the cleaning lady 's just been . <p> I squirted Bactine on Kenny 's knuckles , and he bit the neck of his shirt , even though I did n't think it could hurt as bad as he was making it seem . <p> " Okay , " I said , " you 're good to go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , and we watched rap videos and did bong hits until Mrs. Sharf called from somewhere in the yard . <p> " Kenny , your father wants you to rake the leaves up . Kenny , can you hear me ? " <p> Kenny made a face , did n't bother to stash the pipe . He yelled , " Mom , it 's gon na snow . " <p> " Kenny , your father says he 'd like you to rake the leaves . We 're having company . Kenny ? " <p> " Fucking Christ , " Kenny said to me . " Like , no kidding . " <p> So we raked , squinty-eyed and mellow , and in the middle of raking , the snow commenced to filter down . <p> " You see , " Kenny said , ripping at the leaves with his rake . " This is exactly the shit they pull all the time . Do you see what I mean ? It 's snowing . I said it would be snowing . " <p> " So let 's stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raking these leaves . " <p> And so that 's what he did-raked through the flakes-and I helped him , both of us just in our thin sweatshirts because Kenny wanted his parents to feel bad for making us cold . And just to make sure they noticed , Kenny lit the leaf pile on fire instead of bagging it , and we stood around the smoldering little heap just waiting , a wind cutting through us , tiny wet snow crystals melting on our skin . <p> Nothing changes , I thought . When Kenny was ten , he torched the upstairs den , and his parents did n't even yell or ground him . They just gave him the basement , his own space , a move which , I guess , I can understand . The basement is n't too flammable . It 's got access to the yard . And it 's a place for Kenny to be instead of picking fights on basketball courts after school . <p> My mother brought my good clothes over along with the salmon pate she brings to this party every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were milling with drinks . My mother met me in the kitchen , eyes bugging like she 'd never seen me before in such ratty gym clothes . She turned to a withered lady in a shiny green dress . " Honestly , " my mother said . " From the look of him , you 'd think we did n't have money to buy him clothes . " <p> I took my things to the upstairs bathroom , and by the time I was dressed in what my mother thought appropriate-blue Dockers with too many pleats , white oxford , red sweater vestmost of the other kids had arrived . I could tell because I saw their parents . Saw my father , too , in a pack of other fathers by the bar . He raised his drink and motioned me over . I played dumb , waved once , hustled back down to Kenny 's private space . <p> Some nights , maybe after a fight , or a car crash , or a particularly bad loss by the Bulls , you could find ten kids down there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depending on the event . Terry Mayday shot Brad Grinnel 's dog . Richard Hoffman smacked the clerk at 7-Eleven . Who knows if we were any different from any other groups of friends . But people were always showing up . Everyone knew the way . <p> This holiday thing was like a reunion . Kenny , Missy , and Betsey Nelson-back from Skidmore College with a bouncy new hairdo-were playing slap-n-flinch when I walked in . Big , Lumpy , Hollywood , Billy Boo the millionaire bike thief , a guy called Dish because of his big ears , and a few of the other clowns from our school were swilling champagne on the sofa . My man Ross Meyers and his girlfriend , Naomi , showed up-first time ever-and Ross was walking around nodding , going , " So this is Christmas , yesss , I likes , I likes , I likes . " And up above you could here the grown-ups shifting chairs and slurping eggnog and munching ham to the tune of " White Christmas . " <p> Missy was so wrecked . Eyes half-closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled them on top . So now Kenny was concentrating on Betsey , who , at the moment , was examining his knuckles . " Do they hurt very much ? Was it a very bad fight ? " Missy stepped between them . " I want to hit , " she said and stuck out her lip . <p> " You have to win first , " Kenny said . " You need practice , you really do . You 're not at all fast . In fact , you 're slow . Merry Christmas and all , but you 're slow . " <p> Missy spun in place and careened toward me , mouth glistening , hands held out . Her perfume smelled like maraschino cherries , and I rested my big paws on her soft palms and let her go off , huge drunken slaps to the backs of my hands . I 'd known Missy since ninth grade , when she moved here pregnant from San Pedro , California , and Kenny , even though he was n't responsible , sold stolen Polo shirts from Marshall Field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to talk about it . <p> In the middle of the room , Kenny and Betsey kept playing , hands lifted so that if you did n't know better , you 'd think they were rehearsing for some formal dance . Kenny looked so cleancut over there , khakis cuffed just above the scoop of his shoes . I could see what girls could see in him . He had a presence , and he had this room . Missy pressed against me . I wrapped my arm around her and patted my pocket . " Got a card for you . " <p> " You 're sweet , " she said , still paying attention to Kenny and Betsey . " You know I do n't owe him anything , " she whispered . " I do n't care if it is Christmas . " And then she stalked off in her tight little skirt , with her short shapely legs , into the room where the lights do n't work and where Kenny 's father keeps his unused tools . From the sofa , Billy Boo offered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and he winked and nodded toward the toolroom . <p> " She 's not like that anymore , " I told him . <p> He waved his hand at me , knocked back his champagne , and went after Missy , the thought of which-the two of them tanked and slobbery-made me sick . <p> I wandered out the storm door and into the backyard , where the new slushy snow lay barely an inch deep and the blocks of light stretched from the Sharfs ' kitchen windows across the pale muck . Missy had n't asked for her card , and now it felt heavy enough to drag my pants down . The air was turning colder , and on either side I could see inside Kenny 's neighbors ' lighted homes . On the left you had the O'Donnells in their hardwooded den , cocktail city , the whole clan seated before a huge , gaudy tree . On the right you had Mr. and Ms. Berkowitz in the kitchen with their three slouchy sons , everybody snarfing , heaps of food . And with all these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was out there or had any idea of what I felt capable of doing . <p> I made a snowball , squeezed it tight , then added more snow and squeezed again until I had a fat , hefty ice-ball . I edged around to the front of Kenny 's house , leaned in the shadow of the porch , cold pinching my lungs and stinging my fingers , not a single thing moving on the sidewalk or street . The first car that passed , I blasted it , fired a strike , and then listened for the hollow smack as I bolted back to the bright lights and red faces of my best friends . <p> Kenny was in a corner , flashing bills , probably giving away money , which is something he had a tendency to do . Ross was imitating a fight ref and doing the rules for Christmas dinner : " No turkey football . No drinking from the baster . If you got ta gnaw from the bone , you take it outside . " <p> As for Billy Boo , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hollywood was saying . I saw him sniff his fingers and then let Hollywood sniff his fingers , and I felt sick all over again . Where was Missy ? I did n't see her anywhere . Then I looked to the toolroom , and there she was , stumbling out of the darkness like a horror-film lady , hair mussed , big breasts hanging free , thick , ugly blood bubbling down her left wrist . She threw a drywall knife at Kenny and Betsey and streaked past us , out and into the snow . <p> We had to tackle her and cover her mouth to keep her quiet . Kenny squeezed her wrist and held it up while me , Ross , and Big dragged her back downstairs . Then Kenny held her still while I pasted on about fifty Band-Aids . She 'd made a mess of her arm , mauled the skin up , but not too deeply and not vertically along the vein the way her friend Julie Fisher had . I squirted Bactine on top of the Band-Aids and helped Kenny dress her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of her heavy cold breasts , one at a time , to get them set in her bra . Her blouse went on easier . Naomi smuggled down a bright red sweater-from where I did n't know-and we put that on her , too , just in case some blood leaked through at church . The whole time , Billy Boo kept shaking his head , mumbling , " Sorry , Missy , I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry . " <p> Finally Kenny just snapped , " It 's not your fault already , Bill , so just shut up . " <p> Missy smiled then , and I wondered if she knew what was happening or who was involved . She never once opened her eyes . And when it came time for midnight mass , we all rode with our parents , in separate cars , except for Kenny , who said he 'd ride with Missy and her mom . <p> The priest called out , " By the light of the redeeming love , " and we all answered , " Fill our hearts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say in the program . <p> We were sitting in back , or at least near the back , and we 'd downed so many drinks that even with Missy there leaning woozily on Kenny 's shoulder , looking faded , we somehow felt loopy and ready to giggle . Everything was just so ridiculous : all our trim , good-hearted parents in bright outfits , every last one of them clueless and loaded to the gills . You knew it soon as you stomped in , soon as one of the dads took your coat and pumped your hand , smelling of pipe smoke , green Tic-Tacs , and underneath it all reeking of gin . <p> The thing that fucked us up was Kenny 's tie . We were standing to sing , and when we sat , Kenny 's tie flopped over the pew in front of him , and a fat lady leaned back against it . Kenny was pinned . He had to bend forward and turn his head , and everybody had to bite their lips to keep from laughing . I did , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds started to jiggle out of me , and I squeezed fast toward the aisle . <p> A minute later , Kenny met me down in the gym , where we rolled on the floor and laughed so hard we could n't make noise . The backboards loomed like friendly ghosts . Kenny kicked his shoes off and balled his socks . <p> " Quick game of sock ball ? " <p> " I 'll kill you . " <p> " I do n't think so . " <p> " I think so . " <p> Just then , Kenny 's father flicked up the lights . <p> " Is there a problem here , Kenny ? " he said , squinting into the new new brightness . <p> " No problem , Dad , " Kenny said , loudly . <p> " Well , then , what are you two doing here ? I mean , your mother and I were wondering about you upstairs . " <p> Kenny shrugged , and Mr. Sharf looked sad to have to be asking us stupid questions . After a minute or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twisted his mouth into a grin . " Think I made him mad ? " I stared at the floor , Kenny 's bare feet , and then the next thing that happens is Kenny 's peeing . It 's the gym in our church . <p> " Why , Kenny ? " I said . " Why ? " <p> I walked home with Ross and Naomi so I would n't have to face my parents or Kenny or anyone else that would set me off . Out on the street , our footsteps crunched , and the air smelled of pine smoke , and all the big homes winked with tiny lights . So we were walking . Ross and Naomi said they thought mass was cool-so much incense ! so much singing ! -and now they wanted to try hanging an actual ornament on an actual tree . <p> " I do n't know , " I said . " You have to do it just right . " I was trying to goof on our whole situation , trying to forget about Missy 's bloody wrist and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ on the cross . I just wanted to enjoy who I was with and what we were doing . But it was hard . Like we had to walk past so many familiar streets , so many houses of the friends we 'd known forever , and especially past Missy 's mom 's dinky flat with the twostep porch and the dark spooky windows that made me worry . Missy 's card was in my pocket . " Hold on , " I said . " Can we . . . I mean , do either of you have a pen ? " <p> Naomi patted her pockets and searched her coat and came up with a red felt-tip . " It 'll do , " I said . " Two minutes . " And I hustled up to Missy 's and stood there shaking while I ripped open the envelope and took out her card . It was just a silly Hallmark on which I 'd written , " Love , Santa . " Now I x-ed out the Santa part and penned in KENNY . The porch wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that was that . <p> My mother was up waiting when we reached my house . I did n't have my keys . She was in her nightgown , and she had a champagne bottle in her hand . She pressed her face to the door glass and said we could n't come in . <p> " Mom , come on . " I was embarrassed in front of Ross and Naomi , embarrassed that this was my mother and that this was Christmas . " Mom , they just want to see the tree , and then we 'll go out . " <p> My mother waved the bottle and shook her head . " Nooooo . I 'm in my nightgown , pumpkin . " <p> I apologized to Ross and Naomi and ran around back . " Mom , open the door . Mom ! I 'm serious , they just want to see the tree . Five minutes . Seriously . We 're going to leave in five minutes : ' <p> " I 'm in my nightgown , sweetie : ' <p> " Mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want a whole herd of your friends traipsing through my house in the middle of the night on Christmas Eve when I 'm in my nightgown . Now , do n't make me wake your father . " <p> " Mom . Let me . The fuck . In " <p> " No , Philip . " <p> I ran to the front . Ross and Naomi looked scared . I did n't care . I climbed like a madman-up the small pine beside our porch , up the porch roof 's slanted shingles-toward the window . Down the hall , I could see my mother flying toward me , flimsy robe billowing out behind . At the window she locked the lock and stuck out her tongue . <p> " Fucking bitch , " I screamed , and I put my foot through the glass to kick her teeth in . <p> She shrieked . A light popped on in the hallway behind her , and I wrung down the tree , scraping my hands and bicycling my feet . A dog was barking . Houselights were coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but then I fell and scraped my palms and just waited , kneeling , for Ross and Naomi to catch up . <p> We were all breathing hard . Naomi gave me a tissue . Ross made a soft , low whistle . " Merry Christmas ? " he said , and we all laughed a little and then walked on , in an awkward silence , breathing dragon smoke , sliding and skittish , heading for the best place we knew to go . <p> A flaming meteor had landed , and aliens had stamped down the snow around Missy 's blood . <p> " Something 's burning , " Ross said . " A bonfire . " <p> And he was right . All this crap from Kenny 's basement was piled in the backyard-a heap of flames-smelling of melting plastic . We could see the flickering shadows from the alley , and we hurried past them , past the black leather couch growing soggy , and down through the storm door to Kenny 's big room , where the lights were blazing . <p> Kenny had cleared the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ripped up the carpet , and the walls were stripped clean except at one end , where he 'd tacked up Charles Wormfeld 's hoop with huge spikes , right into the foundation . A sledgehammer lay on the floor , and the wall had a lot of crumbly holes in it where you could see Kenny must have missed what he meant to hit . The basement ceiling was low , and the hoop was even lower , and Kenny was running back and forth , sweating through his church clothes , sprinting from one end of the room to the other , sprinting , planting , leaping . He had a deflated basketball that he could palm . He was jamming . And for a minute we just watched in awe while Kenny rattled the rim with windmilling monster dunks . <p> He saw us , smiled , took off again to tear the house down . <p> I said , " Come on , Kenny , let 's put this thing out . " <p> Kenny 's eyes looked feverish , and he swept his arm out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blood everywhere . I could n't clean it up . " He was leaning under Charles 's hoop , squeezing the ball . <p> " Okay , whatever , " I said . " Come on now , Ken . I mean , I mean , this is some shit . " <p> Naomi tugged gently on Kenny 's arm , and Ross held the door open , and after some head-shaking , Kenny let himself be led up the slippery wet steps and into the yard , where the flames were still flaming . Nothing seemed obvious . We had to huddle together and stare while we wondered about exactly what to do . There was this smoldering mound , our problem , this circle of light , and then just beyond it , at the edge of Kenny 's yard , there was this dim blackness . We could n't stay warm . Kenny kept stamping his feet and turning to look up at his parents ' dark window . Meanwhile the snow had stopped falling , and God or someone had shook the stars out , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neighbors would think if they noticed us , four kids standing together before a stinky blue flame . Would we look like we were roasting chestnuts ? Would we resemble , in any way , a small family ? <p> 
##1003633 How do you begin to judge your father ? The Coast Guard and the insurance company investigators would list my father as blameless in the boating death of Lamar Locklear , our next-door neighbor and my father 's business partner . The boat-a sportsfisher-was christened the Nell , a name my divorced parents had chosen for me had I been born a girl . My father and Lamar considered the Nell firm evidence that , when I finished college and married Lamar 's daughter , Holly , and joined their electrical wiring company , we would all be well underway towards something better than our backlashed lives along the Haw River in North Carolina . We could n't afford to berth the sportsfisher , so the Nell rode out snowstorms and summer cloudbursts on a trailer which straddled a drainage ditch dug as a property line . Then , when hurricane season lowered the coastal rental rates , we hauled the sportsfisher to Hatteras Island , where each year we vacationed at a sound-side cottage , complete with a widow 's walk my mother had waved from in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breezeway which reeked of creosote connected our cottage to an identical one that our fathers rented for prospective clients . <p> My father and Lamar were happiest these two weeks of each year , especially at dusk , when the cottage smelled of baconwrapped mackerel steaks and Old Bay-seasoned water set to boil , clattering with crabs from our trap . Each evening , when the lighted mainland across Roanoke Sound seemed a piece of the night and stars poured down , my father and Lamar made a ceremony of lighting their boat . <p> " No more arguments or complaints , " my father always said . " The Italian has passed over . " It was one of his favorite expressions-the code words to the Allies that the A-bomb had exploded . Lamar then plugged in a drop cord strung from the cottage to the rickety dock where the Nell was moored , illuminating its outline with Christmas lights . My father and Lamar each threw an arm around the other 's shoulders and hefted their Seven and Sevens : they had escorted us across the sound to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world where executives and senators summered and where the first English attempt to found a colony in the New World had failed . My father and Lamar were determined their beachhead would not give or falter . <p> The night the Lucases were due to arrive , we gathered in the kitchen after the ceremonial lighting , and my father toasted , " Here 's to the Lucas deal . " Frank Lucas was a purchasing agent from Southern Bell . He and his wife had been invited to the island for a fishing trip , and they would be staying in the adjacent cottage . Lamar had bid on the wiring for a new Southern Bell plant which would house satellite construction . Up to that point , most of our company 's jobs had involved houses or restaurants , and were very earthbound . <p> " Here 's to the big executives , " Lamar 's wife , Wanda , said . " Ha . " She sank into a wicker chair in her housecoat with her knees at angles against the armrests . " You call renting this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you take note of this . Richard , " she said to me , " you , too . I could have married anyone , but who did I pick ? " Around the kitchen were cans Wanda had opened and left sitting . Wanda Locklear opened cans when she got drunk and angry . <p> " Our ship will come in , " promised Lamar . <p> " It already has . " Wanda pointed to the sportsfisher strung with lights like a celebration no one had bothered to attend . She was a nurse , an LPN , hooked on gin and codeine , who got cranky when we limited her supply . Holly helped her mother to the bedroom to ready themselves for the Lucases . I slipped in after them while Holly combed her mother 's hair . After Wanda promised not to manufacture a disturbance that night , Holly fed her a pill from the supply she governed . <p> On the mainland , once or twice each year , Wanda would n't come home from work , turning up usually at an interstate motel or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her sedan at an all-night carp fishing pond . When the police brought Wanda home on these occasions , Lamar would meet the squad car at the edge of our shared driveway , wearing Wanda 's housecoat over his underwear and seeming much older than his forty-five years . <p> " You 're a bastard , " Wanda would scream at Lamar and the sleeping neighborhood . " I want everyone to know you 've made me into what I am . " Money would be passed so her name would n't appear in the newspaper . Soon she would sob she had done nothing wrong-she had just gone out for a little fun , and now everyone thought the worst of her . Once , after the police left , Lamar struck her so hard she lost an incisor . Wife beating and noisy front-yard battles were part of our world . Lamar took Wanda inside and put her to sleep . Then he ambled back outside and unchained his German shepherd , Lucky , who slept beneath the raised bow of the Nell . As he dragged the dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splayed paws cut sharp lines in the dirt . The dog had a perpetual spot of mange on its flanks , and old motor oil was thought to be a home remedy for the disease . Lamar always lifted the mutt by grabbing handfuls of flesh along the withers and rump , so that its muzzle was stretched into a grin . Again and again he dunked the German shepherd as it howled . Upon release , the dog shook and rolled in the drainage ditch . As if in need of regaining its master 's good graces , Lucky brought a stick to Lamar , and they played fetch at first light , while down by the Haw River you could hear the mill generator 's high-pitched whine as it struggled to convert water into a substance as ethereal as electricity . I watched them from my bedroom window , convinced that their sorrow would never be my own . I was twenty , and I actually believed I could escape where I came from . <p> The Lucases were a mismatched couple who warred openly . They brought their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frank Lucas kept asking why we had n't invited a swatch of local residents and a senator or two to celebrate his arrival . My father , embarrassed that as renters we knew no one here , blamed the lack of revelers on the stormy Coast Guard forecast . During cocktails , Frank Lucas launched into his life story . Two tall drinks later , his North Carolina rags-to-riches account had exhausted itself . On the third drink , he wanted to arm-wrestle " Mister College . ' He beat me twice , though I tried until my molars ached to slam his arm to the table . <p> " You 've been pushing too many pencils and not enough iron " he said . He was very proud he had risen to purchasing agent without a college education . " Look at what all I got . " He flexed his bicep and pointed to the balcony , where the woman he alternately called " Cheri " and " wife number two " shook her hair back and laughed at something Wanda or Holly had said . Cheri was closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a foot taller , and she wore her boredom as beautifully as any negligee . She and Wanda had struck up the quick , intense , suspicious type of friendship of people who have excesses in common . They discussed which pills to mix with others , and exact proportions . As the women wandered onto the patio , Frank Lucas claimed he golfed weekly with the governor-a man he knew dirt on . <p> " Now that 's power , " he said . <p> " You 're doing fine , " my father said . " You 're living the sweet life . " <p> " Damned right . " Frank Lucas thumbed his barrel chest and crunched on a pretzel as he splashed out the last of the drink he was waving . " I can make you or break you . " <p> " You up for king mackerel fishing tomorrow ? " Any hint of a business deal collapsing made my father skittish . " I bet you 've caught trophy kingfish before . " <p> " I 've hauled in tarpon and marlin . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now there 's two game fish for you . " <p> " You 'll like king mackerel , " my father assured him . " They fight like hell . " <p> " I fight like hell . " Then Frank Lucas went to the bathroom . <p> " This guy 's a jerk , " said Lamar . " What does he mean , make us or break us ? " <p> " He 's just an obnoxious drunk , " said my father . " I bet he throws up all day tomorrow while we fish . " <p> " Hey , bub , where 's my drink ? " Frank Lucas yelled from the bathroom . <p> " Take him a damned drink , " my father said to me . <p> " Let him get it . " I was not taking him a drink while he pissed . <p> " Let him stick it up his ass , " whispered Lamar as the women meandered inside . <p> " I 've got Frankie-boy his drink , " said Cheri Lucas . " He likes to bellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She winked at Wanda . " But he 's really harmless . " She smiled openly at Lamar . " You 're part Indian , right ? " <p> " One-quarter Lumbee , " said Lamar . " Do n't know how the other three quarters got here . " <p> " That 's priceless . I 've heard Indians are big savages . " <p> " I do n't like what 's going on here , " said Frank Lucas , coming back into the room . <p> " You do n't have to like it . " Cheri let her eyes linger on Lamar where they wanted . <p> " Hey , bub . You flirting with my wife ? " Frank Lucas got between Lamar and Cheri . " No one flirts with my wife unless I let them . " <p> " No one is flirting with anyone , " said my father . " Hey , we 're all friends here . We 're all having a few drinks and a nice time . " <p> " That 's right , Frank , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't want them to , and besides , we 're all friends . " Then she walked over and threw her arm around Wanda , who smiled at everyone from the safe place the pills had carried her . " We were talking origins , Frank . I was remarking about the Indian in Lamar . " <p> " I 'm part Lumbee , " said Lamar again . " The Indians who took in the Lost Colonists . " According to legend , the ill-fated first colonists had searched for gold and bickered instead of planting crops and securing their precarious position at Manteo . When winter arrived without Sir Walter Raleigh 's supply ships , they were either killed in a surprise Indian attack or forced to wander inland and lose themselves amidst whatever grace a wilderness had to offer . <p> " I 've got conquistador blood in me , " Frank Lucas said . " I got a coat of arms to prove it . " <p> Cheri Lucas rolled her eyes . " Frank sunk a reasonable fortune into a trace-your-family-tree deal . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know . Frank chose Hernando Cortex . " <p> " Cortes , damn it . " <p> " Cortex , Cortes , whatever . Frank 's choices were limited because he 's a strict Catholic . " She relished the word 's hard c 's . " Catholics never divorce themselves from their past . " <p> Frank Lucas gave her a look that warned this was not the time for this . <p> " You , " she said to my father . " How did you get here ? " " By Buick LeSabre , " he said . <p> " That 's rich , " Cheri said . My father rarely got a joke , so to hide this fact he laughed hardest . This moment of goodwill uncoiled when Cheri suggested they all get raving drunk and have a toga party aboard the Nell . Frank Lucas was quick to produce a camera after they had all changed into bedsheets and Wanda had remarked that a crazy moment like this needed saving . He adjusted the fancy Instamatic on a tripod and fine-tuned the lens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of a wide net with cork buoys and dried starfish decorating a wall . As the bulb flashed , I remembered being a kid thumbing through our photo album thick with people left behind from all the new beginnings my parents had launched their hopes upon . Then the feeling passed , and I took my place with the others as we waited for the picture of our new lives to develop . <p> That night while everyone else toured the sound , Holly and I made love in our room , which adjoined the widow 's walk . Discarded furniture salvaged from a yard sale or the attic of the owner 's inland home gave the room the temporary feel of a place you visit but never fully inhabit . A salty breeze curved the curtain of the storm door . I stripped and lay naked and proud on top of the covers , smoking a joint to the distant collapse of waves as Holly drew her bath water . While the tub filled , she smoked a little with me and giggled when she coughed . Standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explore the parts of herself untouched by the sun . Next she sat before the mirror , combing and twisting her hair into a bun . She clenched the hairpins with her mouth and set into place the coil I would pull down . Finished , she appraised herself in the mirror and checked her teeth . There will be no hurrying this , I thought as she touched up the nail polish on her toes and swung around and blew them dry at me . Holly was most beautiful , women are most beautiful , when caught in the purposeful act of readying the gift of themselves for you . They sense in their preparations the enormousness of simple things-the hair held with the exact number of pins needed to fall when pulled free , or the nails painted bordello-red because she appreciates the fact that you like them that way . As she bathed I thought of her before the mirror , and we seemed in no way connected to our parents out squabbling over spilled drinks and lewd passes and which star to mark a course by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Do n't smoke so much of that stuff that you go sullen on me . " Holly toweled herself in the doorway . Too much pot carried me to a place from which only sufficient sleep could retrieve me . Holly led me onto the widow 's walk . She kneaded my shoulders and soothed me with easy questions : Were summer school classes hard ? ( Yes , I answered , but I had passed them . ) Did I think the Lucases were a sad couple ? ( No sadder than our parents . ) How soon after graduation would we marry ? ( We would decide that my senior year . ) Did I feel our engagement was constraining us ? <p> " What do you mean ? " I asked . <p> " Do you miss seeing other women ? " <p> " No , " I lied . Certain weekends when Holly did n't drive up to Chapel Hill , I slept with a sorority girl named Lisa McQueen , whom everyone called Queenie . <p> " I would n't like to share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you feel constrained ? Is Ron Ramsey still lit up with love for you ? " Ron Ramsey was an apprentice electrician with a stutter and a crush on Holly . She worked as a receptionist-secretary for our fathers business , and once , to demonstrate his love for her , he had unscrewed a sixty-watt bulb , stuck his finger in the socket , and smiled at the bulb 's flickering while his body conducted the current . <p> " He 's nothing for you to worry about . " When she turned me around , we helped ourselves to each other . A previous vacationer had abandoned a lawn chair , and we tested all the positions its unfolding would allow . The weavings made adhesive noises as we shifted love 's positions . By the time we had both finished , we had moved back inside to watch our joining in front of the mirror . We stood like that until we re-inhabited ourselves and became embarrassed . Then we stretched on the bed to spoon . <p> " You do understand we do n't have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Holly had pushed my head into the secure place between her breasts , and instantly I feared she suspected my whole affair with Lisa McQueen . Then I remembered that , before smoking pot , I had told her the story of a college pal and his girlfriend . My pal 's girlfriend had walked into his dorm room one morning with a travel bag full of dresses . She asked him which one he liked . After the shade went down , she tried them all on for him . She danced around in a front-buttoning dress like country girls wear , a miniskirt which barely hid the sweet cleft of her buttocks , an evening gown with slits up the sides , and a shift so loose he crawled under it like a kid . Between each modeling , they made a regular feast of their love . She had even brought over the ingredients for mimosas . " I want to dress for you today , " this woman had said . " Choose . " My friend told her the miniskirt made him want to bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had been drinking champagne and making morning love . Spring break was the next day , and they were traveling to different places , so they stocked up on the way that skirt made them feel . When school resumed , she confessed she had worn his choice to the abortion clinic . Though my friend did n't want the baby-he was pre-med and his life was on a certain schedule-he broke up with the girl . When he got drunk , he 'd repeat the anecdote , as if it meant something whose message he had yet to divine . This was the story I had told Holly earlier . Now , I pulled my head from her breasts and aligned my eyes with hers . <p> " Are you pregnant ? " I asked . " Did you stop taking the pill ? " <p> " Nope ! ' She thumped my head . " I was thinking about how that girl should never have told him about the abortion . It was something he did n't need to know . " <p> " They should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have talked things out . " <p> Holly started laughing . <p> " What 's so funny ? " <p> " When she came over with those dresses , she had already decided to go through with the abortion . " <p> " But was n't she dishonest ? " <p> " Oh , Richard . That woman wanted him to leave her . By telling him what she had done , she was showing him the way out . Come here , " and Holly smiled as she guided my dick back inside her . Downstairs the revelers had returned ; ice was cracked for drinks , and glasses were filled , but we did n't stop , even when I heard someone climb the steps . I could feel them out in the hall , watching . Then whoever it was seemed to understand what was going on in the room , and they shut the door gently , as if we were feverish but sleeping children whose dreams they were hesitant to disturb . <p> The next morning , when the sun shaped the offshore clouds into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wanda and Cheri a few hundred yards into the sound and anchored our old skiff for flounder . I oiled the big Penn reels and changed steel leaders on the Russel lures . Anything that might heave or toss got battened down . I packed the long coolers with block ice my father had bought before rousting me . Then I chipped two blocks for mixed drinks and iced down the beer . We had gathered two bushel baskets of out-of-season oysters the day before , and I shucked them after enjoying the first few 's salty freshness . In the distance a workman hammered at the first of several weekend attempts to winterize his cottage , while out in the sound the women laughed about something . <p> Much of my adolescence was spent rebuilding that skiff or larger boats , for when anything went wrong in our lives , my father bought and renovated a boat . We replaced keels , fiberglassed hulls , covered seats with Naugahyde , and stitched canvas covers to shield us from the elements . Watching Holly and Wanda and Cheri fish , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cinder-block bungalows we could barely afford . Somehow , we seemed happy with the cold tile floors and two-burner gas stoves . These places smelled of homemade oil-and-vinegar suntan lotion and leaking air conditioners and the peculiar odor of previous tenants ' lives . A tube of discarded lipstick rounded by some woman 's lips and hidden in the back of the medicine cabinet confirmed my simple-minded suspicions that others had passed through these rooms , too . Nights , Holly and I peeked from the room with bunk beds we shared . Like cousins , we were pajama-ed and giggling . Our parents danced slowly in the kitchen . Their inland , quarreling existences had been left behind . We slept to their laughter as they played rook or poker or some all-night board game of chance . <p> Some people reel backwards through time when they smell woodsmoke while children build snowmen , others go giddy over a field of summer fireflies , but I am reduced to a blob of sentiment by Paralichthys dentatus-the common summer flounder . They still seem strange , flat fish left over from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sandbars with a piece of the firstcaught flounder 's belly cut into finger-sized strips to imitate a minnow . <p> When my parents were still married , my mother fished alongside Holly and Wanda . I was nine or ten the first time I saw her fish . Kerchiefed , she sat like a man with her feet apart on the gunnel . How had she learned to unhook a flounder so quickly or so easily ? Because of her nervous lapses into hospitals and other men 's many-bedroomed houses , she had always seemed the ghost of my childhood-moody , seasonal , a creature of shut doors and unexplained absences-but when she fished for flounder , I understood my father 's love for her . Each time she hooked one , the rod curved into a smile and the line sang . She cursed if the fish bit the leader , then giggled with Wanda like schoolgirls at naughtiness . Wanda would be braiding Holly 's hair , and my mother would mix gin-and-tonics while my father and Lamar yelled to row in , the carburetor was fixed and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damned boat ? Wanda or my mother would remark . I would pull hard at the oars and practice my oarsmanship . On the way in , the talk would shift to how deliciously bohemian it was to play cards all night and dance at dawn and then drink tonics at nine in the morning . <p> " It 's times like this that I wish your mother had n't jumped ship on us , " my father said , boarding the Nell . He handed me the shrimp he 'd boiled in the cottage . I tossed them in the cardboard box as he poured on the seasonings . We would eat oysters and shrimp all the way to the fishing grounds . He looked at his watch-wishing we were offshore by now-then tuned the shortwave radio . A song on a distant channel mixed with the Coast Guard warnings of moderate to high seas . As my father listened , his face wore the same look as when he talked to my mother with the special telephone extension he had wired from his bedroom window to the fighting chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the business , and he consulted her like an oracle whose luck he felt compelled to court . He gave her counsel on her boyfriends and listened patiently to her confessions . The fact that he could n't have her made her maddeningly desirable . Both my parents loved the Titanic quality of their love . My mother had called just before this vacation to say she was flying to England with some chiropractor . " Do n't let your father screw up this business deal , " she had said to me . " You do n't know the trouble I went through to set this thing up . " <p> My father pitched me a clean bandanna , which I tied on my head pirate-style as he had taught me . " Piece of advice , Richard , " he said out of the blue . " Be careful what you wish for-it might come true . " Absently , he picked through the shrimp and ate some small ones , shell and all . Out in the sound , Holly yelled and held up a doormat-sized flounder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quit scaring the fish and get busy catching more . He watched them for a long time , then he turned to me . He had been trying to get his bandanna just right , but the little flap of triangle kept missing the knot . I fixed it for him . I could tell my fingers on the back of his head gave him barbershop memories of when my mother kept our hair cut . He had even bought her a barber 's chair at an auction in a clumsy attempt to jump-start their marriage . His gift was exactly the wrong thing ; even the garbage men refused to lug it away . <p> The predicted storm system stalled , and the wind lay . Aside from the bilge pump , the Nell performed like a shipwright 's fantasy on a maiden voyage . The rough seas would not arrive until late that night , and the ocean was like a sheet of plastic connected to the sky by a seamless horizon . I mixed drinks for Frank Lucas and Lamar , and we ate with our hands from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the bridge to send him up a few , I carried him a coffee cupful , along with a beer . We were men on water , passing around lemon wedges and Tabasco sauce as we estimated what luck the day would bring . As first mate , my job entailed keeping Frank Lucas liquored up and happy . I shoved the box of shrimp his way and told him to weigh in . There is a pecking order aboard boats , and he was last . When Frank Lucas sucked the heads , too , I almost began to like him . We ate until the last mile buoy , when my father gave the sportsfisher full throttle , and we made what felt like Godspeed with the old Chrysler engine humming on all eight cylinders . We planed at twenty , got a smooth bow spray going , and outdistanced our problems as we sped towards where you must reckon by charts and compasses . When I realized we had long since passed our usual fishing grounds , I gave my father a what's-up look . Blue water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken the Nell this far from shore . <p> Out where the land fell from sight , I got an inkling of why the old-timers called what they saw the New World . It had something to do with inland feelings and left-behind places . You ca n't look at a continent from that distance without imagining a life in its interior . Before , the closest I had come to understanding this were certain autumn afternoons , during high school , when Holly and I drove my motorcycle into the Haw River countryside . We sped by old clapboard , two-story houses set back handsomely from the road . The yards were big enough to be mowed by tractors , and entire families raked and burned leaves . Kids jumped over flames when their parents ' backs were turned , and brothers dumped on bedsheets full of damp leaves , which sent up smoke signals before igniting . Fathers leaned on rakes and watched another end of summer burning . Holly ran her hand beneath my shirt and fingered my navel as she pressed her breasts into my back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we rocketed into the illusion of the road suddenly ending . I imagined I lived in one of those houses with Holly , that I had stopped raking to watch two lovers zoom by . Would I wave at how young I had once been ? would I remark that their speed tempted Providence ? would I wonder at how far inland I had wandered from such recklessness ? That day aboard the Nell , I was a young man getting his first glimpse of an old feeling called the New World . <p> " This is the goddamned life , " yelled my father . He motioned me up to the flying bridge . He claimed I should learn a thing or two about navigating ; after all , the Nell would be mine and Holly 's whenever we wanted . I had driven countless times before , even weaving safely through the shoals of Cape Hatteras when he and Lamar were incapacitated . But my father made a production that day of handing over the wheel . He fetched two cold beers and called out headings as I marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stream water , where big mackerel ran so deep we used downriggers . Whole acres of the ocean 's surface boiled with menhaden , and I trolled through them to catch the kingfish feeding on the school 's bottom . Whenever the Nell felt sluggish , my father snuck below to hand-pump the water the bilge would not siphon . <p> We filled the boat with big kingfish that Frank Lucas fought . Lamar and my father clubbed and gaffed them , and even when there were two fish on , Frank Lucas got angry if he were not allowed to fight both fish to the boat . We played the part of genial fishing guides , even taking pictures as he proudly displayed the largest . Frank Lucas could n't get enough of catching mackerel , and a greedy part of himself would n't allow us to release any . This was before there were ceilings on the number of fish you could keep , and a part of myself was ashamed that we kept fish beyond what my father called " a gentleman 's limit . " Our haul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back from fishing , my father sipped whiskey beside me on the bridge and fiddled with the shortwave radio while I held the Nell on course . I hoped that he did n't see me at the helm as something other than it was . I expected and dreaded a fatherson chat : When would I be ready to learn the subtleties of bidding ? Would Holly and I buy a house near his ? Would we give him one grandchild or seven ? When this conversation never happened , I was relieved . Do n't go into business with your father , my mother had warned . Strike out on your own . This was my last conversation with her , and she had promised to have a drink for us as she crossed the Atlantic . I had thought it a crude remark , but sitting there beside my father , I understood she meant it as a salute , as people at a wake toast a life that has passed . When I caught my father looking up at the sky and whistling , I remembered today was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " We 'll make the dock right at nightfall , " my father said . Behind us , Frank Lucas was tipsy and singing " What Do You Do with a Drunken Sailor . " Lamar led him like a choir director . We habitually sang that when homeward bound , and my father and I joined in , too . Then Lamar remembered that on real fishing cruises , you strung up the fish like those little triangular flags at used car lots . By the time we reached the first mile buoy , the Nell was fringed with mackerel . Lamar even ran up a small one like a Jolly Roger on the outrigger . The Christmas lights got hooked to the generator , and a loose connection made them blink . Fisherman on other boats heading back to port pointed at us and waved the thumbs-up sign . A few displayed their meager catches . When another sportsfisher tried to run up a mackerel and it fell off , there seemed nothing funnier . The gossip on the radio informed us that the other boats had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Landlubbers . " My father clapped me on the back . " Bunch of goddamned featherweights . " Then he broke into all the channels and began broadcasting our adventure . The liquor had gotten to him , and he kept explaining that luck must be pushed and tested . My father believed that the day 's catch was an omen that his own luck was not ruined . <p> When you push circumstances beyond normal limits , you risk discovering things you do n't want to know . Back at the dock , we called the women down to applaud our catch . Mackerel five deep lined the pier like cord wood . Frank Lucas seemed disappointed when my father explained that no one mounted mackerel . We were shirtless and red from the sun and liquor , and we needed a shave and a bath , but we exuded a good sort of frontier feeling . The women sensed and admired this . Holly worked lotion into my shoulders and giggled when the imprint of a quick kiss to my neck disappeared . <p> " Let 's have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frank Lucas had begun calling us that offshore . " Sex and drugs and rock ' n ' rollis n't that how the song goes ? " He called marijuana " hooter " and asked my father and Lamar if they partook . <p> " I 'll try anything once , " said my father . <p> " Righto , mate . " Frank Lucas claimed he had pills , too-speed and Quaaludes . " I 'm a walking goddamned pharmacy . " When he produced a fifty and asked would I take care of the fish , my father said that was n't necessary . <p> " Do n't insult me , " said Frank Lucas . " If I want to give him fifty , I will . Where I come from , it 's customary to show your gratitude like this . " I felt like a valet as I tucked the bill in my pocket . Frank Lucas strung his arms around my father and Lamar and said it was time to get down to some righteous partying and serious business . They walked up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their drinks jingled . <p> " Cheri 's not a bad person , but she 's not his wife , " said Holly . She explained her mother and Cheri had been drinking all day and confessing . Frank Lucas could n't get a divorce from his first wife because he and she were strict Catholics . When Holly asked if I could imagine what it must be like to know the person you loved would never marry you , I said I could n't . <p> " Just put in an appearance , mix them some drinks , and come upstairs to me , " Holly said . " I 'll be naked . " <p> I set about cleaning our slaughter . The dock had a fish cleaning station with a spigot and a humming streetlight high on a pole . I worked in the cone of light . The wind had increased , and the sound was whitecapping . The clouds hid the stars and moon and lidded in the darkness . There were so many fish that I scored them vertically and pushed out nuggets of mackerel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as shooting buffalo for their tongues , but I did n't care . The best part-the cheek meat-I left on the fish . I slung the carcasses out into the dark sound for the crabs . By the time I finished , I had bagged and iced over a hundred pounds of mackerel nuggets . <p> When I walked into the cottage , I saw that Frank Lucas had made good on his promise . Wanda snored with an open mouth on the couch , while Cheri twirled like a dancer around the living room . She spun my way and kissed me wetly on the cheek . Then she started spinning again like an out-of-kilter gyroscope . <p> " Whoa , now " said my father . " Which way do these things go ? " He held a joint in each hand and seemed genuinely confused . He saw me and announced that I was his son-as if that were an astounding and philosophical statement . " Here . " He handed me a joint . " We 've never done this together before . " When I took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was Thai stick-good pot laced with opium . Lamar wobbled from the kitchen with a tray of drinks , looked at Wanda , and gave me hers . Three or four more tokes on the joint made me forget my promise to Holly . I reasoned the wait would make going to her more pleasurable . <p> " Frank , " Cheri said . " You 're a bastard , and I 'm passing out . " She lay down like a tired child on the hard floor and closed her eyes . Frank Lucas gave my father and Lamar a what-can-you-dowith-them look and launched into business . He stroked his chin whiskers and calculated . He seemed neither drunk nor high . How long had he waited for this first scent of the end of a deal ? He assured us he had done his homework ; without his contract , our company would go under . <p> " Point number one . " He looked at my father . " Your ex-wife owns one quarter of the business . She handles her personal life so sloppily she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ca n't afford to . " He looked at Lamar . " Point number two . My friends on your local police force tell me you 've offered bribes on several occasions-not that they ever accepted them . " Then he looked at me . " There are all types of fellowships available for an enterprising young man , especially if the governor made a few calls : ' <p> " You know dirt on him , " I said brashly . <p> " You 're such a bright boy . " He looked at Cheri and seemed to falter . " She is beautiful , is n't she ? It 's a shame she 's lying there like that . Is there a more comfortable place she could sleep it off ? Could you help me carry her ? All of you . " <p> Wanda 's bedroom was the closest . I followed with the high heels Cheri had kicked off . Without any ceremony , Frank Lucas stripped her . I was so high that it seemed like a dream . <p> " That 's not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lamar . <p> " Bingo , Mister College , " said Frank Lucas . " What I need is a little help here . You see , after I 'm dead , there 's a good chance she 'll claim common-law wife rights , and I do n't want that . I want everything to go to my real wife and kids . If we could just get some pictures of a little fake love here , I 'd be grateful . I 'm talking snapshots of one of you penetrating her , or , say , in her mouth . Hell , she 's so Quaaluded she 'd never know the difference . I 'd put the pictures in a safety deposit box and will my executor the key . No matter what claims Cheri made , the pictures would invalidate them . My lawyer suggested this . " I felt a trickle of pity for his indiscreet scheme until I realized we were all desperate . <p> " What say , mates ? " Frank Lucas produced a doubloon from his pocket , which he claimed his grandfather had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pick the leading man . He left and came back with the Instamatic , and he promised he would n't get any face except Cheri 's in the picture . I realized we were all shirtless and half-naked as we fumbled with his proposition . Then I felt someone at the door . It was Wanda , stoned . She focused for a moment and comprehended . I understood she had been in rooms like this before-terra incognita-and that she did n't like them any more than we did . <p> " You all are no better than I am , " said Wanda . Cheri moaned and moved in her sleep , and from where Wanda stood , it must have seemed the naked woman was a willing participant . " Oh , Lamar " she said . " What will we do now that I think the worst of you , too ? " When she shut the door , I realized she had seen Holly and me the previous night , and I was ashamed at this room 's difference . <p> " She wo n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know if he was talking about Wanda or Cheri . We stood there , three men fighting the invitation to violate her sleeping beauty . If I had been asked , I do not know if I would have participated in the coin toss . I only stayed long enough to know that Lamar would be in the pictures . He ungirded himself and set about the sordid business at hand . My father looked hard at me-as if about to apologize that our search for the good life had landed us here-and our eyes met for the first time as regretful men . Whole ages passed between us in that sad moment . Frank Lucas readied the Instamatic , and I remembered that , as a kid , I had believed the way the image developed before my eyes was sheer magic . <p> " Richard , get the hell out of here , " my father said-the last command he gave me that I would ever follow-and as I shut the door , I knew that I would never picture any of us the same way again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Holly , except Lisa McQueen . I began with my nervousness concerning our proposed marriage and ended with our fathers below us sealing a deal . My heart wanted out of my chest , and I could n't sit down , nor stop talking . I chain-smoked cigarettes by the widow 's walk and said I would not join the business . Then I cried the tears of a person who wanted sympathy . <p> Holly allowed me to cry , then said , " Grow up . " " What do you mean ? " <p> " Everything comes with a price . Do you think I like playing secretary to save expenses so you can go to college ? Do n't you think that I worry about our marriage ? Whatever my father did , he did for all of us . You 're so naive it 's almost endearing . You would n't ... " But she stopped when my father and Lamar staggered outside and began yelling at each other . The widow 's walk afforded a box view of their argument . Lamar wanted my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to air their heads . My father explained the Nell was not seaworthy in such rough seas . He screamed , had Lamar drunk so much that he did n't understand the bilge pump was malfunctioning ? <p> " All I 'm asking for , mate , is a little pretend love , " said Lamar . They laughed as if it were the best joke they had ever heard and clapped each other on the back . Lamar claimed they would take a little spin like old times , when they were teenagers who had dropped off their dates and spent whole nights debating love 's mysteries . My father unmoored the Nell , but before he could hop aboard , Lamar gunned the sportsfisher from the dock . My father jumped up and down and shouted curses , but Lamar kept going . I am washing my hands of this foolishness , he yelled . He motioned the-hell-with-you with both palms and zigzagged back to the cottage . <p> " He 'll just putter around the sound and probably anchor off a sandbar and drink until he feels better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he dunks Lucky . " <p> " I hope so , " she said . Holly and I watched Lamar ease around the buoy which marked the channel to Cape Hatteras . The Christmas lights made the Nell resemble an all-night party cruiser out for an aimless celebration . He sang a drunken sailor 's ditty whose words were lost over the grumbling of the engine . Was he simply drunk , or was he running from the part of himself he and my father had traded to close a deal ? My father would have no stomach for electrical wiring after that night . He would sell the company at a profit , thanks to the bid Frank Lucas would award . What no one had counted on were the four sizable life insurance policies Lamar had taken out on himself . Each different policy listed one of us as sole beneficiary . The Nell would flounder so close to the shore off Hatteras that the lights of senators ' cottages must have winked at Lamar as he drowned . <p> But I did n't know any of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk . We simply watched him leave , and I found myself wondering what got rabble like us to this place billed as an earthly paradise . A people like mine were not pleasure-fearing Pilgrims , nor the landed aristocracy of the Virginians who would write the Constitution . We would have never crossed the ocean in an organized migration . What got my ancestors here was any situation in which you decided a change in geography might cure your luck . As the anchor dropped , all we would own was queasy stomachs . Once inland , we became whatever the new landscape required : reluctant but rum-fortified revolutionary soldiers ; willing purveyors of smallpox-infested blankets ; traders of horses and human flesh ; sharecroppers and tent revivalists and , later , owners of used cars and second mortgages and damaged dreams . I do know that whatever feeling Lamar was full of as he drove off-drunkenness or loathing or devil-may-care-fueled the journey from the old world to the new one where Holly and I were standing . <p> " We will not be like that , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard at me , the way a woman does when she is deciding something important . I 'm not sure what words could have saved us then . I remembered my father 's advice-Be careful what you wish for-but it seemed an old man 's useless warning . <p> " Ron Ramsey and I are more than just friends . " She let this information sink in . She was giving me a way out . I started to give her tit for tat , but she put her hand over my mouth , as if she had guessed about my dealings with girls like Lisa McQueen and had already forgiven me . We stood like that until she decided whatever it was she was thinking and it felt safe to take her hand away . <p> Is that what happens when two people find themselves marooned at a new place in each other , wrestling not with angels nor each other but with the sadness of passages ? Once the insurance money came through , we would all move to different neighborhoods and separate lives . I marveled at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a widow 's walk to someone I loved but would leave because a greedy part of myself wanted more . I was still young enough to risk my future without her , but old enough to know that the youngness did n't matter . Suddenly , I was as ashamed of myself as I have ever been , yet oddly , I was elated . <p> For the first time in my life , I made love as an adult , without innocent explorations and with a desperate , hungry roughness . We cursed and clawed and bit . The knowledge that Holly would allow me to be the one to leave made me want to plunder something as mysteriously familiar as her body . I felt full of something I can only describe as the sorrow of conquest-a feeling my ancestors must have dismissed as second thoughts when the sight of the New World took their breaths , while at their backs tugged home and those parts of themselves travelers must leave behind . There would be no end to the new beginnings this fresh-found part of myself would exact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do but hope-like your forefathers-that a course can be charted for a lifetime of moments like that ? <p> 
##1003634 For more than a year , I thought Roman had disappeared from my life . If not for our very adequate postal service , he might have , but the last week of August , I open the mailbox to find an envelope that has been stamped : Moved No Forwarding Address , with an arrow drawn to the return address , tiny and wispily written in the upper left corner : Roman Kelber , clo Janet Peacham , rr. ii , box 8 , Frankfort , ME . There is no zip code . The arrow , drawn freehand , has been traced over several times , so that it is as bold as the return address is faint . The letter is addressed to a woman I do n't know , Deirdre Sm the , in Providence , Rhode Island . Why Roman was writing her , and why he should have written his return address in care of me , is a mystery , but somehow I hesitate to open the envelope . What do you ever find out , with Roman , even when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inconclusive ? Also , it is n't my mail . It is his mail , which he has apparently , for reasons of his own , indicated should be returned to me . <p> Roman visited the Maine house several times the summer Danny and I moved in-the year of the hurricane . A disastrous time , with a storm of sorts going on inside the house as well , caused by Roman and his lady friend , which exacerbated and complicated the problems Danny and I were having . But I 've done my best to put that period out of my mind , and my resolve has been pretty effective , until the day I get the letter . <p> I hold it up to the light and run my thumb along it in horizontal lines , but I am hoping the words will be indecipherable , and they are , so that 's a relief . <p> I consider opening it , but reflexively stop , hearing my mother 's voice saying , " You never open another person 's mail : ' <p> I look all around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Roman , like one of those drawings for children in which the artist hides various animals in bushes and cleverly disguises trees as elongated , vertical wolves , might be watching me and taking in my reaction . That is so paranoid that I immediately get another thought . <p> Being : Call Howie and tell him about the letter . See what Howie thinks . <p> Howie is my best friend . According to my ex-lover , Danny , he was a big part of the problem . As was Roman , of course . All those odd people imposing on him , ruining the silence , making their overt and covert demands on my time . The way I saw it , they had been my family before I met Danny , and I was n't going to boot them out because I had a live-in boyfriend . I thought we had arrived at some solutions : guests on the weekends , not during the week ; objectionable music listened to through headphones ; consult Danny before mowing the lawn or trimming the bushes . You 'd think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the yard , but the noise of the lawn mower distracted him , he said . And sometimes he was painting the bushes , including them in one of his landscapes , so what was he going to do when they were suddenly dwarfed , just inflate them again in his imagination ? He called Roman and Howie " the swallows , " from the old song about the swallows returning to Capistrano , because he insisted on seeing them as homing pigeons , returning always to myour-home . These were the things Danny said to his friends on the telephone . He 'd have his friends think Roman and Howie were the gaping mouth that swallowed the cars of screaming couples as they rode into the fun house . He felt that Howie and Roman expected him to sit with his hands in his lap , listening , being subjected to whatever their speculative fun ride of the day turned out to be : anti-Lacan ; pro-abortion ; anti-Castro ; propuppy . It really made him nervous that there might be a dog . He knew it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible : no marriage ; no babies ; no family obligations unless the request was made in obvious desperation . <p> I was n't the only one who found him frustrating and uncompromising . I often remember Danny at his parents ' fiftieth wedding anniversary , dancing with their neighbor , Mrs. Hill . Danny 's sister 's eyes had been trained on them , narrowed , as if by adjusting the distance between her upper lid to her lower in a fierce squint , she could lock them in place , keep Danny dancing with Mrs. Hill . That party was only a few weeks before the hurricane . He was furious that when we got home that night , Roman was there with a woman , screwing her on the floor of the study , while Jay Leno stood there giving his monologue on the television . <p> " It makes it seem like I 'm a disapproving parent , and I do n't have the slightest interest in playing that role , " Danny said sulkily , upstairs in our bedroom , taking off his suit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throwing the jacket and trousers on the floor . <p> " If you ca n't beat ' em , join ' em , " I said , slipping out of my clothes and lying on top of his discarded suit . <p> " What is this ? " he said . " Three-dimensional sex , like threedimensional tick-tack-toe ? Probably Howie is down in the basement going at it with whatever man or woman he 's picked up also ? " <p> But that particular night , he knew Howie was n't there . Roman had come alone , because Howie was at a funeral . Howie was n't having any fun , sexual or otherwise . He 'd already left a message on the machine saying he was so bummed out he did n't even plan to drive from Newburyport for the weekend . And Roman and his girlfriend had already told me they 'd be going to a party in Vinalhaven-in fact , we expected them to be gone when we returned , but that was Roman : no sense of time ; a conviction that what you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate , the weekend , I thought at that point , was going to be just the two of us , just the way Danny liked it . But then the weather changed . There was a day 's lull , during which Roman and Kathleen still did not leave for the party , and during which time Howie changed his mind and hopped a bus-Roman had Howie 's car-and we picked him up at the Greyhound stop in front of the drugstore . Danny picked him up , because I was cooking . <p> Danny was not all bad . He was a talented painter , a generous man when the spirit moved him , and funny : he could mimic anyone . That night , in the bedroom , he screwed up his face to look like poor old Mrs. Hill 's , and imitated the dance as she 'd done it , favoring her right leg , trying to smile through her pain . Every so often he would stop and pretend to pick up the imaginary person and toss her to the ceiling , or drop-kick her-a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was not always nice . It had me weeping with laughter : Danny , in his boxer shorts , recreating his earlier attempt at a fox trot , his caricature of his partner 's gimpiness so convincing that I really saw her in the room , though she was elsewhere , and no doubt long asleep . <p> " You want to know what to do with a letter sent by Roman to some woman that got returned to you , " Howie says . I can hear him tapping his finger on his computer . He 's been playing a video game . It sounds like large things are quickly devouring small things : a combination roar and shriek . Howie works at home , designing publications on his desktop publishing system . As he works , he often listens to music , plays games on his portable computer , and converses with whoever calls through the speakerphone . Eating or drinking something would also not be out of the question . For people of our generation , this simultaneous taking in of stimuli is n't all that unusual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functioning through their effects . These days , Howie only has the occasional beer , but he 's retained his taste for constant input . I can hear the Japanese rock ' n ' roll in the background . When Howie 's playing a computer game and listening to weird music , you can guess the rest : Diet Coke ; underwear or pajama bottoms ; blinds dropped and lights out , the computer screen and the Jesus nightlight glowing . <p> " You know , " Howie says , " I was just talking to somebody about Roman . And she predicted he was going to get back in touch . Maybe tomorrow a letter will be returned to me . " <p> " Who were you talking to who said that ? " <p> " A psychic . " <p> " You 're kidding me . " <p> " No , " he says . <p> " Well , let 's hear . You went to a psychic . Was the psychic any good ? " <p> " She had Girl Scout cookies on the table by her chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you consult a psychic about , Howie ? " <p> " Whether I should take the job in Silicon Valley . " <p> " And ? " <p> " I should , and rearrange my priorities , or I should stay where I am and admit that my current priorities make it impossible for me to move to California . " <p> " We 're talking Alice VanVleet ? " <p> " I thought you never wanted to hear her name again . You just spoke the offending name . " <p> " I 'm trying to find out about the psychic . " <p> " She impressed me . Had the mint Girl Scouts , not those newfangled ones . She knew Alice 's name without being told . Your significant other is named either Alice or Ann . ' " <p> Alice VanVleet is a bored , middle-aged fag hag . She dumps all her problems on Howie and expects him to make her complicated meals , besides , to which she contributes things she buys at the store , like bottled , fat-free salad dressing and wine only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in the refrigerator . Once , I got roped into going with Howie to her condo for dinner , and she spent the whole evening eyeing me every time I poured from her bottle of chardonnay , talking about her ex-husband 's unwillingness to-as she put it-parent the children , all three of whom were in their mid- to late twenties and still living with her . From what she said , they seemed to do nothing but " be associated with " the Church of Christian Science and indulge their passion for sports . <p> " Did she know Alice VanVleet ca n't hold a job ? " <p> " And she said you were a cynical bitch , and I should stay away from you , " he says . <p> It takes a second , but when he snorts , self-satisfied , I know he 's kidding . <p> " Now , " he says . " Now : you have a letter and you 're calling me to see what to do about it . I would suggest , if you 've got an hour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as anything else you want . My treat . What to give the girl who has everything . " <p> Another snort . When Danny left , he took half of everything . Everything consisted of his aunt 's Limoges , a large collection of unisex winter clothing , such as long johns and down parkas , Salvation Army re-covered chairs , a sisal rug which he had drawn on with Magic Marker to make it look like marble ( he took the rug ) , woven throw rugs with pug dogs on them we 'd picked up at curbside in Somerville , Massachusetts ( he left those ) , antiques bought cheap at auction , and the mahogany sleigh bed , which left me the mattress and box spring on which I sit as I talk to Howie , pleasantly distracted by my dislike of Alice VanVleet . <p> Abracadabra , and I 'm in Howie 's Chevy convertible , and we 're off to see the wizard . Well-it takes him almost an hour to get to my house , but when he does pull in , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough that the top can be down , resolved to either not mention Alice VanVleet or to say something nice about her , since Howie is so counter-suggestible . He fell in with Alice , come to think of it , just at the time he and Roman had the big fight . I 'm not even sure who was to blame : apparently Howie backed out of going halves on a house in Umbria when he heard that Roman 's girlfriend would be along , and Roman accused him of general cheapness and of having secretly made his own plans to invite what he sneeringly called The Cambridge Ladies , so it was hypocritical to pretend Roman had been the one to ruin the plans . It 's always push-pull with Roman and Howie , though . They 've had many of these fights , in which they have n't spoken for months , or even for a year or more . " He 's such a prima donna , " Howie has often complained to me . " He 's so selfabsorbed , he always wants to be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen watching me cook like he 's fucking standing at the end of the runway crowned as Miss America . Have you noticed the way he stands around , as if he 's soaking in approval , as if everybody is just so fucking thrilled to see him preening while onions are being sliced ? " <p> The psychic wears a beautiful intaglio ring and has delicate , long fingers with enviably manicured nails . She 's younger than I expected-probably late thirties . She 's painted the walls an odd lavender that seems to glow pink within . There is a ring of chairs in the center of the room , and nothing else except a small table next to the chair she sits in and , against the far wall , another table on which sits an answering machine , blinking . The overhead light is on a dimmer switch , and the room is neither bright nor dark . I briefly imagine Howie squirming in one of the chairs , talking to the psychic as if she were a giant daisy he could pluck , to find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all the petals gone , he would know , and she would be as she is now , her thin body in a longish green dress resembling a flower stem , her neat bubble of dark hair all that would remain : the black , black center of the daisy . What I at first take as a Cindy Crawfordesque mole is actually a crumb , I see , as she licks it away . Today the cookies are n't on the table , though . Instead , she 's reading a Jane Austen novel . Psychic myself , I realize the Chapstick must indicate she has dry lips . <p> " Yes , " she says , " I can tell you what 's in the envelope . " <p> It sits where I placed it when I first came in , on top of Pride and Prejudice . She looks at it . I look at it . <p> " It 's a map , " she says . <p> " But what does the letter say ? " I ask . Outside , I can faintly hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " There is no letter , " she says . " It 's just a map . " <p> " A map to what ? " <p> " Buried treasure , " she says . <p> I laugh . Instantly , before I can check my reaction . Buried treasure ? <p> The perfectly painted fingernails play church and steeple . " The person has drawn a box . A pirate 's chest . With a skull and crossbones on the lid . Pearls inside , it seems to me . " <p> " You ca n't tell ? " <p> She closes her eyes . Her fingers rest not on the envelope , but on one knee . <p> " It 's a stereo , " she says . " That 's what 's inside the chest . There 's an amp . Receiver . Wireless speakers . CDs and tapes are dumped in the chest , too " <p> " You 're serious ? " I say . " Can you tell what the music is ? " " A pretty eclectic lot , " she says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> They 're all musicians Roman loves . In fact , when I picked up a People magazine in the dentist 's office recently , I wondered if Roman had heard that Marianne Faithfull was coming out with a new album . I had been thinking about him , shortly before the envelope arrived . <p> " Are you interested in anything besides the envelope ? " she says . <p> " Your intaglio- " I begin . <p> " Zeus ; ' she says . " The stone is an old carnelian : ' <p> " Beautiful , " I say . I lean forward in my chair . " The setting is rose gold , is n't it ? It 's so beautiful , but so simple : ' <p> " Rose gold , " she echoes . " Simple , yes . The setting is simple ; he was n't . " <p> " I beg your pardon ? " <p> She says , sounding slightly world-weary , " A complicated man , Zeus . Like so many others . " <p> " My friend Howie- " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to ask , but still I hesitate , because I do n't want to hear the answer . I want to know about his health , exactly how long I can plan on our being able to knock around together . Most of all , I want to know , and do not want to know , the day and time of his death . And : what exact thing will that death also kill off in me ? My sense that the world can be a pleasant place ? My love of gardening , because every flower might forever after look like what I 'd seen in a spray of flowers at a funeral ? Morbid . Morbid . The thoughts I always quickly push out of my mind , though after a while they assert themselves as a headache . <p> " See the pyramids ... , " Patsy Cline sings from Howie 's tape deck . My question unfinished , the psychic waits politely . Does this mean she ca n't read my mind ? Or that she is n't obliged to , if I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? She adjusts the ring , twirling it slightly with her right hand . It makes me wonder whether it might be possible that she 's finding the answers in Zeus 's head , not her own . <p> " Your friend , " she says , tired of waiting for me to speak . " I think your friend will soon transcend his personal problems . " It 's not until I 'm in the car that I realize what she said could be interpreted two ways , and that the second of those ways might be transcendence through death . I turn to him , and he is as real , as solid , as the car itself . He looks bright-eyed , healthy . Happy , even . <p> " See Janet Peacham 's life passing before her eyes , " I say . " What remains constant ? That Howie and Janet go on excellent adventures , consulting psychics about how everything will be . " I look at him . " Do you realize you just spent a hundred bucks to receive news of buried treasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns out to be ? Not jewels and gold coins , but stereo equipment . He must be telling her he 's bought her a stereo in lieu of a dozen red roses . " Here , though , I bog down , considering this . " Do you think he drew her a map to tell her where to find her present ? " I say finally . <p> " Open it , " he says . " Let 's see where it 's buried . " <p> " Then what ? We go excavating ? We find it , and what do we do ? Take it over to the woman 's house and tell her , Hey , here , this is from Roman ' ? " I slide lower in the seat . " I 'm sure he 's given it to her by now . " <p> " But if he has n't , " Howie says , " if for any reason he has n't , it falls to us . Correct me if I 'm wrong here , but this Smythe woman does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bouncing back to you , all but hollering , Open Me ! Open Me ! What do you say , we go there , dig up the lady 's treasure , keep it in the garage , if you want , until he shows up , and then tell him that the joke 's on him . We both know he 's showing up , right ? Did the psychic tell you he was going to get back in touch with you , too ? " <p> It breaks my heart . Under any conditions , he wants us back together again . Not just him and Roman , Howie and Roman and Janet-and we 've all become such different people . Is there any chance that if we met now , for the first time , we 'd still be drawn to each other ? Of course , I 'm more fond of Howie than anyone else I can think of , but that 's because he revealed himself to me so long ago , because our friendship evolved , because we 've lost our families , and friends have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break down Howie 's barriers if I met him today . And Roman : did either of us , ever , really get close to Roman , or is he still orbiting around us , teasing , no greater possibility he 'll plunge to earth than your average meteor ? <p> " He follows through on everything , " Howie says , thinking out loud . He 's completely caught up in this ; he 's experiencing it as virtual reality . " And if she does n't write him a thank-you note , or whatever it is he expects , he 'll get in touch with you and make some half-assed explanation about it all , and , bottom line , he 'll want to know if his goods are okay . " <p> " Let sleeping dogs lie , " I say . <p> " Yeah , but buried Bang and Olufsen ? " <p> " What does it matter ? Why involve ourselves in some peculiar courtship ritual of Roman 's ? I can pretend not to know anything about it , particularly when I return the sealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming , " Howie says . <p> " Yeah , " I say , surprised , myself , at the tone of defeat in my voice . " I know he 'll show up eventually . " I look out the window . No pyramids , though Patsy Cline is trying to conjure them up for me ; just the shopping center . <p> " He 's in love again , " Howie says . <p> Years ago-many years ago-Roman was in love with Howie . When Roman became infatuated with me , it became a triangle . Then Danny came along and struck the side , and took me away . Danny has always been militantly heterosexual , but it intrigued him that I was bisexual . He 'd missed the sixties sitting around graduate school , studying law , as his parents insisted he do , until he finally took a stand , dropped out of school , and worked at a dull job in an accounting firm , and then , when he 'd saved enough money , went to art school . He 'd had several successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in London , where a gallery was representing him at the time . Later , the gallery owner jumped out the window , and the gallery folded . Then we went to Seattle . Then we went to Washington , when Danny got a job with the State Department , before he quit trying to work at pointless jobs just for the money and decided to devote all his time to painting . When he did resign , we were lonely because for some reason his friends from work all seemed to gradually drop him , and there we were , back in the States without our friends from Europe , or our friends from the Pacific Northwest . So we moved to a summer home in Maine and invited my old friend Howie to visit us , and who did Howie bring but Roman ? They 'd just gotten back in touch , after a month-long snit , and Howie thought it would be perfect if their reunion included me . To my surprise , nothing was there : no frisson , no deep feeling at all , except that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason , though I 'd often talked about Howie , I 'd never really discussed Roman with Danny . <p> Soon Roman began to drop by the house alone . He was n't flirting with me , I quickly decided ; he was a little put out I had n't kept in touch , and he was jealous of my happiness , but for a while I actually thought he wished me well . He was never charitable toward Howie , so why would I have thought he 'd feel kindly toward me ? What happened next was that he asked if he could introduce us to his younger sister , who had seen one of Danny 's paintings in New York and greatly admired his work . You can guess the rest : Danny fell in love with Roman 's sister . She was a senior at Yale , a Fine Arts major , a painter herself . A winsome little thing , physically small , at five foot one , with her Janis Joplin tumbleweed hair and sparkly vests she wore over T-shirts to cover her flat little breasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing too-short cutoffs and **25;689;TOOLONG mules , her pink polished toes protruding from the little vee in front , her pumiced pink heels naked in back . So Howie and I grew closer , as we 'd been back in undergraduate school , taken aback by Roman 's outlandish offering of his sister , Marielle , who so gladly modeled for Danny in exchange for critiques of her paintings . <p> Meanwhile , Roman began to show up on the weekends with an assortment of girlfriends . There had been other periods when he saw women exclusively , but this time his interest was lasting longer than usual . Danny and I never found the women much fun , though , and they tended to baffle Howie . Their conventionality bothered me , and the sheer quantity of them offended Howie , who was used to the occasional foray into heterosexuality , but still : young women in Ann Taylor business suits whom Roman , it turned out , had picked up on the train ? One of them was there the afternoon the hurricane blew up , a paralegal named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days in the trailer that had belonged to the former caretaker when we bought the house . In retrospect , I think she might have been too shy , or embarrassed , to spend much time with us . Roman was fifteen years older than she , and he took every occasion to let her know he had greater wisdom . Did she really care for him ? When she returned to me the jeans and tops , the underwear and nightgown , I 'd lent her-she expected to be there only for dinner-something about the way she handed back the soiled , neatly folded clothes made me think she valued them , and I had seen her express none of that care , none of that respectful carefulness , toward Roman . She had spoken little in his presence . There seemed no joy there . All of which reminded me of Roman 's trial by fire of me and of Howie , years before . We had stood our ground and prevailed . We had won , in a way-though look what that winning got both of us : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pronouncements like flash floods , waves of information about the way things should be ( his way ) . <p> The trailer kept its power when the main house went black . From our various rooms , and for our various reasons , we 'd look at that beacon in the night , glowing oddly , the nucleus stained to shine under the microscope . It was obvious that Danny had begun to desire Marielle ; I had begun to desire-not to physically desire , but to depend upon with a kind of fierce desperation that my trust be returned-Howie , the one person who could best understand my own surprise and confusion at the way events were shifting . Wind blew . Wine was uncorked to toast its wildness . Candles burned to stubs . The power lines were down , and it was dark , dark , dark-except for the constant glow of what Howie came to dub " the love boat , " the trailer sinking into the muddy field . Roman took long walks around the wet , windlashed land , no doubt malevolently whistling as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Danny was working as forcefully as if he had been able , himself , to whip up a storm and permanently alter the ground we stood on . <p> Roman , returning ? Howie has to be right , but what is this strange approach ? And if-as he 'd written to Howie in a letter after the hurricane-he has nothing to feel guilty about , but only feels sorry that he has to be honest in telling Howie that the menopausal Cambridge Ladies are too pointless and depressing to be part of his planned idyll in Italia . . . if , as he maintains , it is his curse to have become the messenger who has to reveal Danny 's lack of love for me . . . if he is only poor Rosencrantz , or poor Guildenstern , and if he 's been functioning blindly and blamelessly , why disappear for so long ? He left his job , put the brownstone in the South End on the market , moved out before it was sold ( we heard this from Roman 's mother , who was searching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a self-justifying letter , which he mailed from St. Thomas to his mother in New York and to his father in Palm Beach , with a " cc " at the bottom to Mr. Daniel Obersham ( Mr. ? ! ) and to a psychiatrist he 'd seen many years before , as well as leaving a copy tacked to the door of his office ( the histrionic flourish has never been lost on Roman ) , claiming that the negative energy released during the hurricane , combined with the toxic effects he now doubted he would ever overcome , following his years of chemical dependency , had left him with unmanageable emotions that often took on a life of their own , causing him to provoke those he loved . Only on Howie 's letter was there an asterisk-at least , there was no footnote to the letter Roman 's mother forwarded to Howie , and the psychiatrist told Howie on the phone that there was no physical mark , including a signature , on the letter he received . The asterisk was not typed , but hand-drawn , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it flies too close to your face . At the bottom of Howie 's letter , underneath a larger , darker cluster of splayed strokes , was written : You I have hurt most , not even Janet , yet you know I love you , Howie . <p> Well , indeed . Indeed Howie did know it , but for most of the time he 'd known Roman , that love had been a confusing thing , announced at odd times , something Roman used to manipulate Howie , a standard , almost , to which Howie could either measure up or , more often , and just as pleasing to Roman , fall short of . <p> For more than a year after the hurricane , everyone felt they had had more than enough of everyone else , and even Howie and I hardly talked . I received one drunken phone call late at night from Danny and listened for only a few seconds before I hung up . If it had n't been for the excruciatingly bad news that Howie tested HIV-positive-if he had n't called me from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to talk because of his chattering teeth-I might have continued to stay separate from all of them . The voice control button had been activated on my answering machine , and when I heard that it was Howie , and what Howie was saying , I slowly slid the volume down to off for one second in which to compose myself before I picked up the receiver . The one second stretched to two , three-enough time for many emotions to sift through my understanding : the shock ; the acceptance of the unthinkable ; a hundred plans for reversing the news ; vivid memories of my friendship with Howie , from meeting at age eighteen until that moment , which seemed like many long , painful moments until the time when I would rush toward him , find him leaning up against the side of the plastic hooded phone he 'd called from , looking blankly into a gutter as if he were watching water 's effluence , while leaning against the rail of a ship . <p> We were sailing nowhere . We were moving slowly . Hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else was there to go while Howie said over and over again , like a mantra , " I have n't slept with you for years , I have n't slept with you for so many years , there could n't possibly be a problem . I have n't slept with you . . " Of course , people overheard him , and looked after us as we wove down the street , Howie shaking , me trying to steer him and shush him at the same time , Howie saying through chattering teeth : " I have n't slept with you ... " <p> An observation : people 's personal pain is just another box that will tumble from the back of the truck , spilling your possessions all over the street ; people 's contentment , even their happiness , is the orchid that once bloomed with such waxy perfection they forget it can become blighted ; special moments are the kite carried high by the breeze , when the same day , a plane caught in a downdraft of wind plunges to the ground . You 're lucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blessed if your friends , however peculiar , remain loyal ; you 're admirable if the rug is pulled from underneath you , and you improvise a gawky dance . <p> That 's what I am thinking this morning , just a few weeks after our convertible ride , trying to keep my thoughts as abstract as possible , walking from the parking garage to the hospital , feeling sorry for Howie , because his white blood cell count has begun to sink alarmingly , sorry for myself because I am so little up for this ; and also sorry for the passengers of the USAir plane that crashed , for the orchid Howie sent me for my birthday that I threw out prematurely at the first signs of yellowing , for the moving men who gathered up what they could from a big box containing Howie 's pans and spine-bent books and broken crockery . He decided that if he was getting sicker , he did n't want to be a sick person in the city . And what was his solution but to rent a house close to mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about where he would relocate to get out of the cold . Alice VanVleet , either stupid or intent upon not confronting the specifics of Howie 's situation , was lobbying hard for Virgin Gorda . Even Howie found this amusing . " Does n't the woman know there 's no going back ? " he asked me . <p> Suddenly , there is a short , fat nurse running into the hospital ahead of me , pushing the up button of the elevator , doing an impatient little sidestep routine as she watches the control panel , then runs onto the elevator and rises to her floor as I stand next to her . Whatever floor she gets off at will inevitably be permeated by the cardboard and sugar smell of hospital kitchen-prepared tomato sauce . She gets off at 3 , and I continue on in the elevator , alone , to the fifth floor . <p> I 'm not expecting anything good when I exit the elevator , and naturally I also am not expecting to see Roman . He is there in the corridor , though . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drag some woman Howie would n't know to his bedside . As I come off the elevator , I know it is Roman , even though his back is turned to me and his hair has grown quite long , pulled back in a spout of a ponytail . He is wearing corduroy pants and a jade-green shirt . <p> " He 's using the portable toilet , " Roman says , nodding toward the room 's closed door . <p> " Hello to you , too , " I say . <p> " Do n't be mean to me , " he says . " I just found out , from my mother . " <p> " Your mother ? In New York ? How did she know ? " <p> " She called him because he can always tell her what she 's missed on the Sunday crossword puzzle . The paramedics were there : ' <p> " I sent them , " I say , as if I feel the need to explain my place in all this . " He was so out of breath when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentence . " <p> " They 've given him a transfusion , " Roman says . We both look at the closed door . <p> " Were you planning to be in the area , anyway ? A letter you sent got returned to me the other day . A letter to some woman . " He looks confused . As always , when he is confused by something , he looks much younger . <p> " Roman , " I say , " you put your name , in care of me , as the return address . " <p> " I do n't know what you 're talking about , " he says . <p> " Roman , what is the point of this ? " <p> " A letter from me to someone else was returned to you ? How is that possible ? " <p> It is on the tip of my tongue to say buried treasure , but I do n't . A woman and a teenage girl , looking grim , walk by , arm-in-arm . The elevator doors open again , and three more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her black patent leather purse in front of her , like a shield . A man with a limp walks behind her . Another woman , obviously dizzy with nervousness , walks crookedly to the window of the nurse 's station . <p> " Who is this letter to ? " he asks . At least this time there is a slight hint of doubt in his voice . He shifts his weight from one foot to the other , standing in the familiar way with his left hip thrown out and his right foot turned outward , an almost balletic position . <p> " Some woman . Some woman you probably picked up on the train , or wherever . Remember when the phone would ring , and you 'd say Just some woman ' if anyone expressed any curiosity ? " <p> " What is this ? " he says . " Your feminist sensibilities being offended ? " <p> " I just asked a straightforward question . Howie 's been going downhill for months now . Neither of us had any idea where you were , since you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schedule . Excuse me for being curious about whether you were in the area to begin with . " <p> " I drove from Derry , New Hampshire ; ' he says . " That 's where I live now . " <p> I look at the dizzy woman hurrying by , mouthing something silently to herself . Howie 's move to be close to me I understand but what does Roman have in mind ? He has never liked the cold , and what can there be for him in Derry , New Hampshire ? <p> " Other than this disastrous news about Howie , how was your summer ? " he says . " You know , Other than that , Mrs. Lincoln- " ' <p> " Roman , forgive me , but after all that 's happened , I really ca n't stand here and be asked questions about whether I had a pleasant summer . " <p> " I always change things , " he says . " I 'm cursed with being a catalyst . I do n't expect you to be sympathetic , obviously- " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think I expect enough , " he says , suddenly , quite seriously . " The way I see it , I 'm going with the flow , but it 's a mystery to me : other people see me as the one who 's in control . They look to me for answers . They try to make me into some sort of authority figure that I 'm not . You and Howie have always acted in collusion , like everything that happened between us so long ago was all my idea , something I coerced you into . Why was it all my doing ? Think about it . " He frowns at me . " She asked me if she was correct in assuming that he was attracted to her " <p> " What are you talking about ? " I say . <p> " My sister . Marielle , who stole your boyfriend . " <p> It surprises me , when he mentions it so blatantly . Somehow , I had been wondering about the envelope-the envelope which he addressed just as I said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thinking about the past . <p> " They 've cut me off , you know , " he says . <p> " I did n't know , because I have n't been in touch with anybody except Howie . " <p> " You 're living in Maine year-round now , are n't you ? " he says . " What does it matter ? " <p> " Just a question , " he says . " You know , like your asking whether I intended to be here , anyway . " <p> An orderly wheeling a patient on a gurney passes us , wearing a gray jumpsuit and moon-landing boots . A nurse comes up quickly behind him , then opens the door to the room next to Howie 's so he can push the patient in . <p> " Good , " Roman says , more to himself than to me . " Howie 's still got the room to himself . " <p> It is the first moment I remember that Roman can be kind , considerate . The person Howie and-amazingly-I once cared so much about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I hear myself ask . <p> " Ooooh , " he says , drawing it out , seeming to really be thinking . " My guess ? My bisexuality . He 's a pretty straight arrow for an artist , Danny . And of course she 's always been Little Miss Goody Two Shoes . If things do n't hit her in the face , she does n't care to see them . " <p> " Your sister did n't know anything about your life ? " <p> " Did n't , apparently , until I hit her in the face , in a manner of speaking . Took a guy with me when we went . . . this is going to kill you : the four of us went on a reggae cruise one night . Sailed out of Portsmouth . " <p> The orderly passes by , says , " How you doin ' ? " <p> " Good , thanks , " Roman says . <p> I offer a false smile , although he 's already passed by . I stare at the backs of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been inflated with an air hose . But this is certainly not the moon . Very few people , except for visitors leaving , are taking one giant step here . Everyone moves slowly , bent under the weight of their worry or grief . A woman holding on to an IV pole wheels it along , a needle centered in the side of her wrist , smiling apologetically as she passes . <p> " God , this is awful , " I say . <p> He drops his arm around my shoulder . I feel myself stiffen , then slump tiredly . Why had Roman been the one in charge ? Because he was better-looking than either of us . Because , embarrassing as it is to admit as a grown-up , the most beautiful person got to be the one in charge . It did n't hurt that he was the most charismatic , either , or that he had his own apartment . Because Howie and I had both been weak , in a way , smitten with beauty , and we 'd both wanted to be captivated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what Roman had , just through osmosis . As if on cue , the minute I figure all that out , the red light above Howie 's door comes on . He is finished ; he is calling the nurse to help him back to bed . There is no nurse anvwhere in sight . <p> " You go , " I whisper , drawing back . It seems clear that Roman should be the one to help him off the toilet . I feel sure that would embarrass Howie less . <p> At the door , only three steps away , Roman stops . He turns . He says , " A couple of times I 've driven by your house . I was trying to get up the nerve to come in and apologize . I had a rehearsed speech-a pretty good one . And then one time I decided to rely on that old dependable charm , I felt like luck was with me that particular night . That our stars were aligned , or something . I got there , and there was a Jeep in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " the orderly says , passing by , as if he has n't greeted us before . <p> " So that stopped you , " I say , finishing his thought for him . <p> " Right . It stopped me . " <p> " I do have friends , " I say . <p> With that he nods , then turns and opens the door , starting the difficult but still no doubt familiar process of going toward his old friend Howie , turning his back on his old friend Janet . It is symbolic , I think , feeling sorry for myself . It is n't just a turned back , it is the back he 's turned before , more times than he should have . And that is when the unexpected image comes to mind : the three of us , in bed , twenty years before , a not-yet-sex-sated Roman turning toward Howie , his ass jutting into my groin as I push forward to curl against him , his vertebrae pronounced because of his thinness . Drugs were food , and sex was love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way I used the tip of my nose like a finger , running it lightly up his spine , breathing in the smell of Right Guard and sweaty skin , which had been synonymous , at that time in my life , with actually inhaling freedom . <p> Later , after a slowly eaten dinner , we go to my house . The Jeep is parked in the driveway ; the neighbors ' daughter 's prized vehicle , which there is no place for in their two-car driveway . I do n't explain it . I pull a bottle of wine out of the old oak mailbox that functions as a wine rack . There are two bottles , and I take the better of them out , uncork it wordlessly , pour two glasses half full , push one glass closer to Roman . <p> " You 're careful , are n't you ? " I ask . <p> " About drinking ? " he says . <p> " No . About sex . " <p> He looks at me , genuinely surprised . " Yes , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He is suddenly not only looking at me , but staring . Can he possibly , madly , mean his steady gaze to be a come-on ? <p> " Of course I 'm careful , and of course it 's no fun , " he says . <p> I lower my eyes , sure now that it 's not my imagination ; he has been holding open some possibility . Sex is n't fun ? He and I could have fun ? In my house , half-emptied of furniture , with absurd rugs thrown here and there with pug dogs woven into them , in this place that I meant to live in so happily with my lover , visiting with my dear friend and soul mate Howie when he was well , physically well , no nightmare disease hanging over anyone . . . in this context , today , now , Roman and I could fall into each other 's arms ? Uneasily , as I 've done before , I look around me because I sense some presence . Is it guilt creeping in , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something ? Or do I still think the younger Roman is hovering somewhere , hidden like the wolf in the tree , the Roman whose ghost hangs over us both : a ghost that Roman ca n't exorcise any more than I can-that dynamic , seemingly fearless person that Roman used to be . <p> I get the letter . Along with letters to be answered and bills to be paid , it 's been in one of the cubbyholes of the mailbox . I hand it to him , and , again , he looks surprised . " Well , look at it carefully , " he says , finally . " It 's my handwriting on the address , but it 's Marielle who . . . why would she have done this ? She obviously filled in the return to be in care of you . Why would she do that ? " <p> " I thought they 'd cut you off , " I say . <p> " They have . I have n't seen them for months , since the boat ride . " He puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had it in my jacket pocket that night , I think . I remember now . She wore my jacket because it was cold once we got out on the water . That 's right ; she did . She even wore it home in the car . She must have thought she was doing me a favor by mailing the letter the next day , but she did n't know my address , because I 'd just moved to Derry . So she asked Danny what your address was , and he told her . " <p> " Sherlock Holmes , " I say , raising my wineglass in a toast . <p> " But why did n't she put her own address on it ? " <p> " You tell me , " I say . <p> " Maybe because she thinks about you a lot . She 's guilty , and it makes her preoccupied with you . " <p> " She thinks about me ? What does she think ? " <p> " I do n't know . She used to bring you into conversation all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you by talking about you . What do I know ? " <p> " Well , " I say , handing him the letter , " I hope you were n't expecting a quick reply . " <p> " Actually , she saved me from making a fool of myself . It was a pretty intemperate letter . I was angry because a woman I 'd been seeing- " <p> " Some woman , " I say jokingly , mocking myself as much as him . <p> " Yep . Some woman , indeed . Issued me an ultimatum-could have told her that would n't work , right ? -insisting I set a wedding date , or the relationship was over . I 'd never misled her about anything , and it set me off . I wrote her and told her I 'd been straight with her from the first-what was she doing , suddenly demanding things like that ? " <p> For a moment , I 'm too surprised to react . He was serious enough about the woman in Rhode Island that she thought he 'd marry her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he might truly have indicated that was a possibility ? <p> " What did she say ? " I finally ask . <p> " You 're holding my letter , " he says . " She never got it . Maybe she 's so dumb she thinks I 'm still mulling it over . " <p> My thoughts are flooding : The buried treasure ; the buried treasure ... the skull and crossbones . The stereo equipment . Tapes by Astor Piazzola . But I ca n't mention those things . There 's no way I can contradict him without having to explain . Why is he making up such a detailed story ? Why tell me about the messy situation at all , if all he 's going to do is lie ? <p> " Open it , " I say . " It would be like old times . I could see what you sound like these days when somebody pushes your buttons . " <p> " It 's better forgotten , " he says . <p> " You wo n't open it ? You wo n't even read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then shrugs . He hands me the envelope . " Read them yourself , if you really want to , Janet . " <p> This is even more perplexing . The envelope is suddenly in my hand . When he hands it to me , though-when he gives me permission to open it-I realize instantly that whatever the psychic said had to have been mere invention . She was a charlatan , just as I 'd suspected . It is not a map ; it is an irate letter , telling a woman in Rhode Island that what she wants will never come about . The fortune-teller was another person , another thing , Howie put his trust in inadvisably . <p> I rip open the envelope . Then I get my next surprise . <p> Where I expected a letter , there is , instead , a map . On one corner , someone has drawn a tornado or , more likely , experienced some frustration getting ink to flow out of the pen . Just as the psychic said , there is a fairly detailed map , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top braced open , spilling from it not jewels and coins , but revealing stereo components and many tapes . In another drawing , a maze of streets leads to the chest . The streets are named , and arrows point the way . <p> Coming up beside me , Roman says , " What the hell is that ? " <p> " Buried treasure , " I say , at last . <p> " What the- " He grabs the piece of paper from my hand . " My God , she 's completely crazy . She really is completely crazy . What did Marielle do , steam it open ? " <p> If he were n't so earnest , I would n't even half believe him , but I do half believe him . I decide that there is at least a fifty-fifty chance that he thought it really was the letter he just described to me . <p> " Unbelievable ! " he says , pronouncing every syllable , staring at the piece of paper . " I knew Marielle did n't like her , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a letter that . . " <p> " What is it ? " I say , helpless now in my confusion . <p> " It 's what you said it was . It 's buried treasure , " he says . " It 's even got . . . look at the road names . She 's written the street names right on the page . She 's lost her fucking mind ! " <p> I sit on a kitchen stool , frowning . <p> " Somebody broke into Deirdre 's apartment one weekend when we were away . They-Jesus ! -there 's no they about it . My insane sister did it . She took her stereo and hid it in the woods , obviously , and then , on top of that , later she steals my letter and sends Deirdre a map showing her where the stuff is , and naturally , since it 's in my handwriting , what would Deirdre think but that I was responsible . That I put somebody up to the break-in . My God ! What if this had n't come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . It does seem bizarrely malicious . Also , he does seem incredibly lucky . But more than that , I see that for the millionth , billionth time , I 'm involved in his life again , helpless and awed by the madness , fascinated but repelled . Roman becomes Pac Man , eating up time . That 's what he 's like ; he 's like Howie 's game of Pac Man , a little figure racing around the screen , voracious , wildly energized , everything magnetized by his megalomania . It 's just another moment in Roman 's life , in which so many colleagues are jealous of his brilliance there 's always a movement afoot to get him fired , but this time-this time it 's his own sister who 's tried to do him in . Earlier , in the hospital , Roman was onto something . He sensed something similar to what I 'm thinking now ; he was on the track of himself , when he made the remark about being a catalyst . I take a deep breath , wanting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the way he lives that he invites these things . Yeah , sure , he finds people who are complicit , but since I 've been one of those people , I 've developed a lot of sympathy . You stand at the shore , wading in gradually , and suddenly there 's a tidal wave , an undertow , Roman arranges it so there 's no lifeguard but him , and when you finally escape-grateful to him ; always grateful to the savior-your metabolism is set a little higher , those endorphins have been set loose , the next day , you need the next high . The beach was just a mirage , though . You look everywhere for where you were , but it is n't there , or never was . But Roman is there . So you attach yourself to Roman , to the great magnet who pulls you slowly in . <p> So how did I lose my charge ? I wonder now . How did I ever escape to the extent that I did , and what is it that made him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allegiances ? Because of all the time I spent with Danny , before Roman found a way to intervene ? Or because I 'd opted for true friendship years before-because it quickly became obvious that I liked Howie better : reliable , unglamorous Howie . That conclusion must have hurt Roman , but the more I drifted , the weaker his pull became , so that all he could do was stay in close proximity . Let me see what being a loser in love was like . Let me experience loneliness . Wait until illness threatened to take my best friend away . See if that did n't make me go running back to his side . And he is now to be found in New Hampshire , a state conveniently adjacent to Maine . <p> " I 'm afraid of her , " he says . " I 'll be honest with you . I 'm too freaked out to go home tonight . I 'm afraid I 'd call my sister and say some very , very regrettable things to her . You 've got to protect me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay calm . She 's stark raving mad-you see that , Janet , do n't you ? I 've got to figure out the best way to deal with this : ' <p> The guest room , the one painted blue , has always been referred to-because he always chose to sleep there , those rare occasions he was without a girlfriend he wanted to screw all night in the quiet of the trailer-as " Roman 's Room . " He is telling me now that he must spend the night there-the first time he 'll have been in the house overnight since Danny left . <p> " You know what , Roman ? " I say . " All the time you 've been talking , I 've been thinking the most terrible things about you . " <p> " When have you not ? " he says , taking my hand . " When , ever , have you not ? " <p> Sitting in the red Jeep in my driveway , late that night , I relive it : the time Roman arrived with Howie , bringing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't determine the weather , but how fortuitous-how fortuitous the facts of Roman 's life have so often been : the sky flashing bright with lightning , trees dropping like pick-up-sticks in the gusting wind , candles lit as the power went out , the panes of glass shaking in the old windows in need of reglazing . That unremitting , wild weather that always leads people to band together to resist nature with all their strength . <p> I meant to stay safe inside . While Howie and Roman and Danny took silly chances , chasing after ambulances and fire trucks on foot , going to inspect huge fallen oaks with power lines tangled like deadly IV tubes through them , Danny-so I 'm toldstripped and jumped in the river , laughing and bobbing crazily as spiky waves lashed him . So much physicality must have come as a relief . In spite of his cynicism about life in general , Howie always retained his schoolboy crush on Roman . He must have suffered when he faded into and out of Roman 's affections , even as a friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women over men , but that those women were most often such small , pale , compliant creatures . The parade of women was like a parody of the two of us ; they 'd inevitably have little energy , little to say , they 'd seem , perhaps , only to have one hidden agenda , and that would be their desire to marry Roman . Then , if any got close enough , he 'd tell them our history , and if that did n't work , he 'd repel them by going to a bar and dancing , or flirting , with men . <p> Sometimes I fixate on the night of the hurricane , and this is turning out to be one of those times . The neighbors ' daughter did n't have a red Jeep then , she had a different car that I let her keep parked in my driveway , a banged-up Buick that was painted a nondescript brown . She 'd given it the nickname " The Mudmobile . " Although I was alone the day after the hurricane hit , I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that so many large , substantial trees had been uprooted ; the snarled power cables were dangerous snakes of electric current coiling through the maples and elms ; more wind than I expected blew up around me , forcing tears from my eyes , so that after a few minutes of standing and staring , I took shelter in the driver 's seat of the Buick . While I was sitting there-a silly sight ; a driver going nowhere , I reflected even at the time-mulling over the first dramatic arrival of Roman in Maine , accompanied by his amazing singing tiger , Howie ( truly , he had introduced Howie to Danny this way , casting himself as the person who cracked the whip , and at the same time making fun of the tiger-striped scarf Howie wore around his neck ) -well : it was Howie who was my friend , and , however unadvisedly , he had brought Roman , but the way Roman presented it , he was running the show , Howie was just one of the acts . I was n't even on the billing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking about that , thinking about Roman 's unkindness toward Howie , envisioning a circus-a real circus , Barnum and Bailey-remembering how excited I had been as a small child to be seated with my mother at ringside , when suddenly , or maybe not so suddenly , because my eyes had been closed , and I had been in another world , there was a tap on the car , and I jumped with alarm . Frightened myself , I had also frightened the person who 'd done the tapping : Roman 's girlfriend of the moment , Angie . I rolled down the window . <p> " The men are all off inspecting the damage , are n't they ? " she said . <p> " Yes , " I said , " Right . " Flustered . Embarrassed to have been so lost in thought that I 'd been easily frightened . <p> " I know you 're his best friend , " Angie said . " I hope it does n't put you on the spot if I ask you a question . " <p> " Whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she looked at me a little strangely . Then-I should have thought to offer-she walked around to the passenger 's side and opened the car and got in . " Roman 's , " she said , pulling the door shut with a click so delicate I was n't sure the door was closed . She was a sweet , gentle girl . She found it difficult to make eye contact . " I know you 've known each other since you were eighteen . He says you 're the only person he totally trusts . " <p> " I did n't see Roman for quite a long time , " I said . " For quite a while after I got together with Danny , I found I really did not have any desire to see Roman . " <p> " Ms. Peacham , " she said . " What are you doing in the car ? " <p> " Is that the question ? " <p> " No , " she said . " But what are you ? " <p> " I wanted to get out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here for me . So I thought I 'd sit in the car for a minute . " <p> " The trailer 's sunk in the mud , " she said . " Roman says it 's going to have to be pulled out with a tractor . " <p> We both looked at it , through the car 's streaked windows , lopsided and glowing . I remember thinking that we inherited such odd things . I was looking at a trailer , on a triangle of land across from my house in Maine . Inside were plants . Gesnariads . The caretaker who 'd lived there-or more likely his wife-had grown them under grow-lights clipped to pole lamps and window ledges . They were almost all dead when NV bought the house , and I started trying to nurse them back to health . I had the sudden thought that Angie might think the plants were mine . That I had no better idea of how to care for plants . It seemed important to tell her that certain things had just befallen me . I was about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , finally , meet my eyes as she turned toward me in the seat . She was in her early twenties , but she could have passed for a teenager , her face bare of makeup , her eyes startlingly large and quite lovely without it . She looked a little the way I 'd looked when I was her age , but she had real natural beauty . <p> " I do n't think he loves me , do you ? " she said . <p> After quite a long pause , I said : " No . I do n't think he does . " <p> She swallowed . " Is it because he loves you ? " <p> " No , " I said . I said it instantly , reflexively , though I 'd been taken aback by her question . " You know when a person loves you . Roman has never loved me : ' <p> " Did you ever feel the way I do ? " she said . " I mean , did you ever want him to ? " <p> I decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Roman is our friend , but I think Howie and I both were worn down into friendship . He 's very demanding , as I 'm sure you 've noticed . There 's a real bond , but it 's not friendship , exactly , and it 's not love , either . To the extent that he cares about anybody , he cares about me and Howie , but he does n't love either of us , and he never did . " <p> The information registered , I saw . <p> " Does he always set women up ? Want to fight with them , I mean . " She was biting her bottom lip , her eyes averted , her flaxen hair falling forward , nearly obscuring her face . <p> " Women , in particular ? I 've never thought about it . I think he just likes to be provocative . He prefers to be the center of attention : ' <p> " Is this what your life is like ? " she said . Her voice was almost a whisper . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give her that morning , along with a pile of other clean clothes , as he was returning to the trailer after having his breakfast and coffee . <p> It was an excellent question : Was it ? A person sitting in her driveway , world torn up around her , power out , food in the refrigerator spoiled , an odd hostess hostessing an odd party , taking time out from the talk and the games and the " remember when 's " that would continue for many more nights , amid burning candles , in the aftermath of a storm . <p> " You could leave , " she said . " Could n't you leave ? " Not so long after that , it was Danny who left . Intermittently , Roman and Howie arrived , and then departed . Now Howie may either be in residence full-time , or , if he 's unlucky , he may never be in the house again . And Roman . Right now , Roman sleeps in Roman 's Room . <p> The girl , though , is long gone-someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed , in the moment , to pass off as a rhetorical question . For our own reasons , that day , because of Roman , and also because so much of what she and I wanted to believe in had been uprooted , toppled like big trees in the storm , our levels of unhappiness had risen to the same level at the same time . When she slipped her hand in mine , it was as if we were momentarily powerful , contiguous . It was as if we were one great river , not separate bodies holding their own courses . <p> 
##1003635 Today is my fortieth birthday . I do n't feel old at all . I 've been sitting here for a while , on this courtyard bench , and if she 's coming , then she 's late . Married couples walk around , trying to interest each other , pointing to the faded pink walls and to the iron balustrades . The men tell the women facts from guidebooks , pretending these are things they know . Wind fans the blond hair of one young man as he takes a surreptitious photo of his bride . Photos are n't allowed here . She grins pinkly , arranges her white hat over an ear . I can see how happy this makes her-not the photo , but the consciously illegal pose . They 'll look at the picture years from now and remember most of all the camera 's secret whir . <p> I do n't see anyone who looks like my wife , but then I 'm not sure what she looks like these days . In college , where I first met her in the mid-sixties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theaters , professorial bars , psychology debates-and always entered late . It was her rule to be obvious . She 'd show up in a brown plaid dress and blond hair curled in a neat cyclone on her head , and everyone would watch . They all would notice this strange thing-her eyebrows were painted on , and one was drawn in a hysterical , curious arch . That was what I first noticed in her : this painted expression . <p> We never talked until the day she grabbed me outside the refectory and insisted I go with her to audition for a movie filming in Providence . I refused until she intimated that my overbreeding showed in my lack of adventure . So I went , and I remember they wrote down on my card " handsome college type " and on Britta 's " wild girl type " and we both got parts somehow . It was a terrible Rock Hudson movie , Halls of Ivy , and if you ever catch it late at night on television , you will see Britta 's gigantic hat and laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one second , the frame of action slows , drawn curling and enamored into the bewildering dream of her life . <p> So we dated for a while , the kind of formal dating set up back then . At least , that was how it began , but Britta was n't interested in wearing a sweater across her shoulders and having me serenade her . I think she saw in me just enough reticence to be a challenge , just enough self-control , but also the kind of curiosity that , in spite of myself , made me smile and shake my head and follow her . The Rock Hudson movie , the greyhound races , the shop of occult necklaces and masks . She would try on a headdress of silver coins and turn to me , that eyebrow leering under the mail , and I thought here was a girl who could never come home to Kentucky . <p> Once in a while she went to my parties . There was one in 1964 , a New Year 's party in Boston held by a fellow I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a beautiful apartment , with an iron spiral staircase and brass Indian poppies littering the railing . It was Beacon Hill , and everybody there was Harvard or Yale or Brown ; the rule was always no Princeton ever because they stole the girls . The Jabberwocks loved Britta , but you could see the other Pembroke girls in their navy woolen kneesocks and yellow oxford button-downs cringing , shocked sometimes at Britta 's loud banging walk or clumsy maneuver with the matron 's teapot . Britta embarrassed me , too , getting " clobbered , " as the Jabberwocks liked to say , at cocktail parties and relating filthy stories to amazed young men , keeping us waiting forever while she searched a gutter for a Celtic necklace she had lost there-a hollow silver band which rattled at a touch , for inside were druidic talismans of hope . I bought her that necklace . She played an awful doubles tennis , but our opponents always asked for more matches because Britta 's constant deep laughter was entrancing . <p> She and I walked into the upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so we had to drink Gibsons , which Britta pretended she preferred . A few men were in the corner singing a drunken " Aura Lee . " <p> " You know where I 'd rather be , " Britta whispered to me . <p> " Do tell , darling " I replied , looking around at all the school ties . <p> " On an island . " <p> " Any island , darling ? " <p> She stared and me and clicked her tongue . " No no no . I 'm very specific , and very serious . Saint Eustatius . It 's Dutch , with a rain forest and a volcano and very mystical crabs . " <p> " Those islands are colder than you think . I 've been there with my mother . " <p> " But it 'd be great . I would n't ever drink Gibsons , or listen to ' Aura Lee . ' I 'd be a pirate , a gilded white scorpion . Would n't it be wonderful ? " <p> I did n't say anything , because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the balcony , I caught my friend Marshall all alone , smoking a long cigarette and staring at a view he must have found tiresome . <p> " What kind of host are you ? " I asked . <p> " It is n't my party , really . Sally wanted it . " A Radcliffe girl he 'd been seeing , and seemed bored with . He waved his hand girlishly . " You and Britta are my only friends here . " <p> He must have said this for Britta 's sake , for she was just then arriving through the glass door , saying something to a group inside who laughed suddenly and loudly . She turned to us , closed the door , and rolled her eyes . <p> Marshall blew smoke out and asked her , " How can you do it ? Why does everybody love you , Britta ? " <p> " Are you saying nobody loves you ? " I broke in . <p> " Oh , that 's no trick at all , " Britta answered him , shaking her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You ask people about themselves . They go on and on and then turn and tell their girlfriends what a marvelous conversationalist you are . " <p> I remember she smiled and turned away from him to go back inside , breaking her own rule to make Marshall think he had been let into some secret life of hers , a crueler one . <p> Marshall was new to the Jabberwocks , still a sophomore like me and slightly in awe of the secret ceremonies and histories of the group , though things like school and girls seemed not to interest him . He was tall , with curly red hair and nearly invisible eyebrows , but handsome and resolutely Irish in his chin and small , pink lips . <p> We had become friends only that Thanksgiving , when we were both invited to be on the Floor Committee of the National Debutante Cotillion in Washington . We took the train together , drinking Scotch the whole way , and met our stiff and beautiful debutante dates quite drunk , our hair messed up and our red sashes disarrayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage , their escorts two steps behind , the girls were quite serious , but Marshall and I had a blast despite them . We had been to enough cotillions to be bored of the rituals . When the waltz came , and all the escorts were to tap the fathers ' shoulders and release the girls into the world of men , we both took our dates into foolish jitterbugs , then waltzed off with each other to the bar . No one said a word , because Marshall 's family was powerful-wealthy Washingtonian Democrats who had been invited to the front row of the Kennedy funeral . That night at the New Year 's Eve party , I remember he wore a tie clip with a small photograph of Jack Kennedy under gold mesh . The tie was Andover . Mine was Kent School for Boys . Those things mattered to us then . <p> " Hey , Paul , " he said to me . " Did Barick say you were moving up to tenor ? " <p> " He 's making me . He 's crazy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was cold . Yet we were drunk enough not to mind being alone out there . The only light came through the eyelet curtains , and it beaded on our backs like luminous rain we could not shake . The air was deep blue , and all in front of us , Boston spread out in a sagging post-Christmas carnival . <p> Marshall went on , " Oh , he likes the idea of a black-haired tenor . He 's tired of us redhead Irish stealing the show every time . " <p> " But I 'm Irish . I 'm Black Irish . " <p> He seemed determined on this point , shaking his empty glass which glowed in the dim light like a deep-sea creature : " No , no . You , my friend , are Scotch Irish . You can tell from that nose you 're a rogue clan . You have to have dominion over everything , especially women and horses . That 's the South . That 's your dear old Kentucky-every one of them rogue Scotch Irish . " <p> " I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He turned away from me and lit a cigarette . " What does he do again ? " <p> " He 's on the radio . " <p> " Runs the station ? " <p> " No , " I said , laughing a little and letting him pour me more gin from a bottle at his side . " He has a show . He 's Mr. Social Security for Western Kentucky . They ask him questions , and he answers them . He 's kind of famous . " <p> " Wow . That 's strange , Paul . " <p> I pictured my family sitting in our living room in the summer , the electric fans blowing and my mother sorting her Butterick patterns while we listened to my father over the radio . He advised old , frightened Kentuckians in that countrified way of his about how the government would provide , always and forever . It was a government-sponsored show . " This is the Age of America , " he always said to those folks , and they were grateful to hear it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was proud to have comforted them , people who had lived through so much , their children always hungry , going to bed cold . My father knew all of that-his family lost a logging mill in the Depression . All of our money came from my mother . <p> I am proud of him now , but back then it was an embarrassment . I did not know why I was so anxious to impress Marshall , but there he sat , his hair gleaming from the apartment lights , that school tie , the beautiful way his white hand rose above his head to touch the brick . <p> " I have to go and host , " he said , looking up at his own hand . His neck was thin and half-shadowed as it stretched . <p> I leaned to let the light catch my watch . " But it 's almost midnight . You have to stay just a few minutes . " <p> Marshall brought his face down , but his hand played with the brick . I remember he smiled drunkenly . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will want to be near me when it comes time to kiss . " I chuckled , sounding like my father in my false comfort . <p> " All right , you bastard . " I stood up and felt the chill of the air . I turned towards him , and the light from the apartment 's curtains dotted me . I must have seemed mystical in that pointillism , seen through a filigree . He sat for a moment , then needed a hand getting out of the chair , so I pulled on his wrist . He was very light , and his wrist was adolescently bony , and cool . Marshall was only nineteen . So was I. That was a long time ago . <p> Noises came from the apartment , foolish clacking noisemakers and bells and those shrill plastic horns . All of the cabs on the street began to honk merrily , and a whistling firecracker went off somewhere below . <p> " So I have to go , " he said . But now there was something fierce in the air : he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frightening thing . His pale face became ruddy , fiery at the cheeks . He jammed his lips together . <p> I said the sort of thing we always said : " Well , give Sally a kiss for me , too . " <p> But it was n't the right thing to say . Marshall still stared around him , searching all the tiles of the balcony . He only said , " I will . Tell Britta I 'll marry her . " <p> Laughter came loudly from some men inside , and our singing group began to sing " Auld Lang Syne " in Scottish accents . <p> " I guess we should be inside , " I said . <p> " No , " Marshall said , giving a sudden look , bright and insistent . We stood there for a moment . As he stared , his cheeks burned away in the cold air . I know what the look was now . I suppose I must have appeared the same way . It was : This is the word I 've been searching for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . <p> " Nothing , just let 's not go in just now . " <p> " All right . " I put out my right arm to settle him , touch his sleeve , but it felt ghostly , as if it floated out by itself in the dark light . Marshall must have seen my hand palm-out to him . He grimaced at me and crossed his arms , and I put my hand back in my pocket . Or rather-the hand floated back to my pocket . We were both shaking with an uncertain shame , and shame was such an important part of our upbringings . It must have been that which made me smile , despite all my discomfort . <p> It was the most frightening moment of my life up until then , because somehow I knew neither of us wanted to be in there with our girls . We waited because it seemed someone had something honest and painful to say , but it was not said , so we stood halfshivering , amazed and innocent on that balcony , only nineteen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Certainly in that moment I was loved by someone . <p> And then Britta walked onto the balcony . I turned my whole body away from Marshall to face her . <p> " It 's 1965 , " she said , then waved her hand . " So are you guys going to kiss or what ? " <p> Marshall looked at me and laughed , then nodded and put out his palm . We shook hands-ridiculous-then he left through the glass door . Britta watched his progress through the room , the various stolen kisses I could hear but not see , then she folded her arms and looked at me , shivering . She looked radiantly happy . <p> " What ? " I asked . She shrugged her shoulders . " What ? " <p> I walked forward and kissed her for the first time . We had been dating for a while , but never had I kissed her because Pembroke girls were notorious for anger at such points . And Britta always laughed and turned away whenever we were close enough . She let me kiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then pulled away , and her face was as angry as I 'd imagined . I thought to myself , You did it wrong again . But she patted my shoulder , as if the anger were about something else entirely . <p> " You 're a puzzle , Mr. Robinson , " she said . <p> " Not really . " <p> " No , " she said , smiling . " Not really . " <p> Britta walked over to the balcony and leaned over the rail , thrusting her head up to catch the new wind . I stood behind her and watched her gold hairdo unravel . <p> I finally pulled out a cigarette and offered one to her . When Britta turned around , I tried to read her mind , but as usual it was impossible . I had dated many girls with wide expressions , but Britta was illegible . She took the cigarette and let me light it in her hand . She looked up into my eyes when she was done with the flame . She would always do that . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was a bad thing for the Jabberwocks because Marshall was sick , too , and we were the only tenors who could hit " How High the Moon . " Also , Providence was warm and plush with magnolia at that time of year , and all the Pembroke girls would waltz down Thayer arm in arm , their Bermudas flapping and their capped teeth dazzling each bitter young man they teased . So I lay in my dorm room , my roommate having dropped out a month before and gone back to New York City . I watched the fraternity men throwing footballs and shouting names of girls they loved too much . <p> Britta pounded the door in that way of hers to find me dressing for a Jabberwock cocktail party with the university president . I remember she was all in green lace , a dress and a vest , with a worn , brown leather bag thrown over her shoulder . She kept yelling at me to get back into bed , and when I would n't and stood delirious in front of the mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cup of tea . I drank it all down , and within minutes I was dead asleep on my bed . <p> I woke up hours later to find Britta smearing cold cream on my face and humming faintly . She had tied her hair up and taken off her vest , so she was only in that green lace dress . <p> " Ah , " she said . " You 're alive again . " <p> " God , what happened ? " <p> " Oh , I drugged your tea . " <p> I could n't move , but sat there feeling her rub the cream into my skin . <p> " What ? " I complained faintly . <p> " Do n't move . I 'm cleaning your face . Being sick makes you greasy . " <p> " You mickeyed my tea ? Are you a Communist or something ? " <p> Britta wiped her hands off on a towel and knitted her brow . " I was n't going to let you meet President Keeney feverish and strange , was I ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snickered at that and brought over a box of Kleenex to wipe off the cold cream . My view of her face was blocked by those tissues passing over me like clouds . <p> " How do you knows " I began again , " that I 'm not on some drug which would react strongly to sleeping pills ? " <p> " Do n't be a child , Paul , " she said . " Sit back . I 'm going to give you a dry shampoo now , so do n't move . " <p> " A dry shampoo ? " <p> " You look awful . " Britta brought out a bottle of baby powder and began sprinkling it in her palms . " Besides , " she said , " I want to talk to you about something . " <p> She dangled her fingers above my face , and some powder snowed down on me . Then she slid her hands into my hair , rubbing at my sick scalp and cleaning me all over . I felt utterly helpless and ill , and she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said , " what do we have to talk about that you must drug me ? " <p> " I 'm tired of living in the dorms , Paul . " <p> " Yeah , really . " <p> " You are , too , right ? " <p> " Those frat guys drive me crazy with their boozing . " <p> " So we 're both tired of living in the dorms . " <p> " I applied for off-campus permission , " I said , closing my eyes as she stroked my head with powder . It was a lovely feeling . <p> I heard Britta say , " You know that wo n't work . No one gets offcampus permission except married couples . You have to be married . " <p> " Right , " I said . I sat there for a moment , eyes closed , until I realized she was staring at me . I looked up , and she took her hands out of my hair and put them on her lap . She sat very ladylike on my bed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throat , her wide pretty face , the hair slightly wild piled on her head . She was expecting me to be wise at that moment . <p> " Oh , Britta , " I said , " we 've only been dating for a little while . " <p> Then her composure dropped , and she laughed . She got up off my bed and walked to my door . <p> " We have n't been dating , Paul . You kissed me once , half a year ago . " Britta closed the door and locked it . She leaned against it and widened her eyes at me . It almost looked like pity . <p> " What is it , then ? " I demanded . " I spend every waking hour with a girl , and we 're not dating ? And now you want marriage ? " <p> " Paul , " she said , her chin to her chest , " we 're not lovers . We 're beards . " <p> The men playing football began to sing the Brown fight song . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What does that mean ? " I asked . The moment was entirely frightening to me . Britta seemed a nightmare creature of my delirium at that second , instead of my best friend . <p> " We 're covers . We 're false lovers , because we ca n't tell anyone who we really love , can we ? " <p> " Who is it ? " I asked , sarcastic and fearful . " Who is that I really love ? " <p> " Paul , I 've met your father , " she said , walking towards me . " He would disown you . I know my father would disown me . They love us , but they 'd kill us before they knew . And then what kind of life would we have ? Not this one . I like this one . " <p> " Who is this secret lover ' of mine ? " <p> " What a relief to just be married like they want . " <p> " You 've got mono , " I said confidently . " You 're the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , sitting on the bed and putting her hand over mine . " Marshall is . You and he have mono together . " <p> I threw her hand from me . I felt nauseated . " What are you saying ? " I said . I raged my fingers through my hair to get the filthy powder out of it . A cloud surrounded me , but Britta did n't laugh this time . She put her finger to her lips and whispered harshly : <p> " I do n't want to talk about it . I have women lovers whom you need never meet nor mention . I 'm not asking to discuss your love life . I 'd rather we never discussed it . I 'm asking for you to listen this once , Paul . " She put her hands on either side of my chest , and a worried look came over her face . " We 're unlucky . People are talking , Paul . Saying I 'm a man , and you 're a pansy . If we make a mistake , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart . And we 're creative . " <p> I said nothing . Powder settled on her dress . <p> I will never understand how Britta knew everything I did or felt . It had only been a few months before , over spring break , that I had gone to Marshall 's house on Long Island . I always did thisthere was no special occasion . His parents were gone , as they usually were when he asked them , and we spent a few days getting cold in walks along the gray beaches . We became more and more silent with each other , and yet I was insistent that we take these walks . There was some kind of tea dance going on at Shelter Island , and that afternoon I suggested we go . I wanted to distract him from whatever was worrying him-I 'm sure I needed distraction , too . There was a faint flurry falling outside , unseasonable , and Marshall had lit a fire . He was proud of the fire . There was something in his father which always made Marshall pointedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray sweater and , not looking at me , agreed . Then he suggested we arrive roaring drunk . Of course this idea came like a relief . <p> His father had a habit of storing half-drunk martinis in the freezer and forgetting them , so we started with those-there was no other gin in the house . Then we mixed drinks for each other . Not cruelly , though it began that way , but exotically . We made drinks like vodka and creme de menthe , which Marshall held up to his red hair . He knew doing that would make him beautiful . He made me drinks of blue-eyed curacao . Soon it was dark , and we forgot all about the tea dance , perhaps had never really meant to go . <p> I remember watching him talk . I thought it was a trick of my heart . But there , just for a moment in his eyes , his parted lips , I could tell his mind was whirring . I saw the muscles twitch . But really , in the Yankee conversation and polite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unordinary instant , and I thought it must have been the colored drinks he kept handing me . <p> Marshall played records for me , songs I did n't quite like thenmodern jazz and odd , foreign classical-but we danced with invisible debutantes . We made false conversation to them , ridiculed them . We practiced shaming them with cool WASP weapons . Then we danced with each other , silent , not touching , and then , of course , wrapped warmly like an old couple near the end of the night . Then our heads tilted back , and I looked at him . Marshall 's face was in a shadow , his stare at me the only bright thing there , but I could hear a tiny noise come from him , a kind of realization-huh-and then he smiled . And then , to make him close his eyes , I kissed him . <p> The bed we awoke in was two hundred years old , and it surprised me that nothing was different in the snowless morning . I began the lover 's doubts : Why is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's turned over as he wakes and he 's looking at me . There , now he 's holding my hand . What does he mean ? I caught his eye as seldom as I could , out of simple fear . And I almost bolted-only because I knew he was not going to leave . <p> " Think about it , Paul , " Britta said to me that day of her proposal . " You 're in trouble now , but this could make things very easy . " <p> I turned away from her , out to the window where the other men beat each other on the back out of laughing brotherhood , which was also a kind of loneliness . <p> " I 'm asking now because I 'm getting scared for us , " she said , getting up and pulling her brown bag off the floor . " And because that yellow house on the hill is for sale . Remember we walked by that house , with the white columns and the widow 's walk ? " <p> There was a knock on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a child caught burying her allowance . It was a lovely face , serious and innocent . Britta glanced at me and unlocked the door . Two boys from my singing group came in , with a Mason jar of chicken soup and a folder of dirty pictures . They were quiet around Britta , but after she left they told me about the Jabberwock party the night before and produced a note from Marshall , sick a floor below me , a note sealed in an envelope . They showed a boyish awe when I told them I was engaged . <p> Britta and I were married in October , in a small ceremony in Maine . She wore a band of daisies in her hair , and a white ribbon trailed down her back onto the ground . Marshall was my best man . I did not know the woman Britta chose as maid of honor , but she was beautiful and brunette and nice enough . The Jabberwocks sang at the reception , and Britta and I danced to " How High the Moon . " Marshall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I spun that grinning , ribboned young woman around the floor . <p> My mother bought us the yellow house on Meeting Street , and when Britta came wide-eyed into my bedroom with a photograph of a divan she 'd cut out of The New Yorker , my mother helped us buy that , too . I still have that divan . The wood is deep yellow , and a sea of striped white silk covers it . We had an upright piano , a Baldwin , and acres of bookcases were built into the walls to house Britta 's collection of foreign books and fairy tales . My bedroom was the " master " bedroom , and my wife slept in the guest bed draped in a ridiculous fall of mosquito netting , which she said made her feel exotic and safe . We were twenty , the same age as my parents when they were married . <p> The arrangements were unspoken but clear . Marshall came over " for dinner " as often as I liked , but he never interfered in the time Britta and I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dare her to make a dinner from them , and she always took the dare . And her meals were always abysmal . Her frequent lovers came through back stairs and parked in the church lot . I rarely met them except late at night , when I crept downstairs for a book and found Britta and a woman , beautiful and sweet or harsh or distantly intelligent , whispering sincerely over sherry . Britta was never angry to see me . She always pulled her peacocked kimono close around her breast and smiled . <p> Britta often saw ghosts and haunts around this old merchant town , and sometimes sat in her guest bed throwing coins to tell the future of all her friends . She would yell out the fortunes to me , things that never made any sense : " A woman , " I would hear through the wall at night , " crosses from a wide lake to a river , " as if that explained it all . <p> We did n't live through the sixties , not the sixties everyone else seems to remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would blow up the Supreme Court for a cause . They were Brown men who despised their parents ' fortunes , wore only Salvation Army brown cotton jackets , but always their gold watches and rings gave them away . We listened to Dave Brubeck and not Charlie Parker , Tom Lehrer instead of Woody Guthrie , because what we sought was cleverness and not sincerity . None of our crowd stormed University Hall , and we watched with only mild interest as more and more colored boys entered our classes . It neither upset nor thrilled us . The change was utterly separate from the lives we had always led . <p> Marshall threw a party in my honor at our graduation in the spring of 1967 . It was in the mansion of an old faggot professor we knew , a mansion down on Benefit Street with its cobblestones and brass horse-rails . A young Portuguese boy had been hired to ensure no champagne glass ever got below halfway full-he crept around handsomely , insistent with his bottle . Soon couples were dancing on the furniture , the Pembroke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ties of my Jabberwock brothers . Marshall poured half a glass into my hair and messed it around with his hand . His own hair , I remember , was copper and curled from the heat of dancing , smoothed back with sweat as if he were from the thirties . He laughed and looked around for someone else to torment . It pained me that even at my party I could n't simply reach over to this man I loved so achingly and brush an eyelash stuck to his cheek . Too intimate , too kind . He faded off into a crowd . <p> " I saw a ghost in our house , " said my wife beside me . <p> I looked at her , and sadness must have been on my face , because Britta 's smile fell for a moment and she lowered her shining glass . She wore blue-black velvet and luminous false pearl earrings in gold . <p> " You what ? " I asked , breathless . <p> " Are you all right , Paul ? " <p> " You saw a ghost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , then took a sip of champagne as a forty-five of the Kingston Trio came on to boos and hisses . " In our house . It was a man . <p> " Were you scared ? " <p> " Would you ask that if it were a woman ? No . It was a very old man , very tired , I think . " <p> " Did he say anything ? Where was this ? " <p> " In the kitchen . Just before we came . He did n't say anything , " Britta said , putting her hand to her chest . " He stood there confused as if it were an accident , the wrong house , maybe the wrong life to interrupt , and he stared at me not knowing what he was supposed to be doing . " <p> " What did you do ? " <p> " I stared at him the same way . . . I think . . . and then he was gone . " <p> Britta looked at me , thinking to herself . One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me regretfully , flashing her marriage band , then giving a vampire face meant , I suppose , to scare me back into the party . I was thinking about other things , too drunk to separate the petty from the profound . <p> Marshall was caught up in this graduation . I think he was obsessively worried about his life after this , giving up all this to work for his father , or , perhaps worse , to go to law school . And maybe he was afraid I 'd move away-I still do n't know . But something made him shake me away when I grabbed his arm and whispered for him to be quiet-he was saying uncharacteristic things to young men . His glare was n't just anger-he was sad , maybe disappointed in something , maybe in me . <p> The party went on all night in that old merchant house . I remember that the walls were striped with gold paper and that iron sconces lit up faces with flattering candlelight and shadow . Otherwise , the evening passed as many other evenings had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us secure in futures there and in wives . I passed out in a dining room chair , and awoke to someone telling me the baritone had kindly driven my wife home to bed . Britta was famous for never saying goodbye . I fell back to sleep with those walls of gold stripes papering my dreams . <p> In the morning , I was on the Oriental rug . I got up to go to the bathroom , and felt the left side of my face was ragged and burned from the carpet I 'd slept on . I saw others asleep and drugged on couches , their jackets or wraps thrown over them by someone kind and sober , the sun reaching over them to light the paintings framed on the walls , all of willow trees . Outside , a radio was playing " Aura Lee . " I climbed up the spiral stairs to the bathroom , but there was someone inside coughing . I thought maybe I 'd try one in the master suite-the professor had already left , and the door was half-open . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silk covers lay my lover , Marshall , and the Portuguese boy , drunk and dead asleep , shirtless and embracing with a harem of embroidered pillows fallen around them . I remember them well . I remember most of all how sweet they looked , how honest , really . Though he was a liar to me , my lover seemed so poignant with that dark boy clutched to him , as if they comforted each other the way young boys do when they have lost a thing together . I leaned heavily against the door and watched the room for a while . The light came in through sheer white curtains , slow as a tide . All around the ceiling , urns with wreaths were stenciled , and above the bed a blue cherub holding a bird . A common bird : a sparrow . <p> I remember the only thought that went through my head as I walked home in my rumpled evening clothes : I have no claim on him . No one knew I loved him . I assumed no one ever would , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our house that morning , I called out Britta 's name , and no one answered . The wooden floors glowed yellow with the May sun , and all the glass door handles sparked with light as if electric or releasing secrets . Perfume from some early morning bath still hung in the air-eucalyptus , I remember-and it scented the cold white walls , the framed maps of Maine and Rhode Island , made them intriguing , as if they trapped inside their surfaces unimaginable gardens . I remember it , of course , as beautiful and strange , and yet I am sure it is only memory because I know I slumped into an armchair and began to cry . <p> I do n't know when I had ever cried before that , not since grade school , certainly , rarely in front of anyone and never in front of my father , but all alone in that warm wooden room , I wept , and because I was so out of practice , I wept loudly and badly . I panted and held my face to stop the pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that needed no convincing , spitting long jeweled strands of saliva onto my lap as I bent over . My jaw shook , humiliated . The sounds I made were ghastly , but this was too much pain . I could not bear it . So I sat there childishly blubbering into the fabric , lost and generous at last with my pain , shipwrecking myself over and over against my old memory of love . <p> I felt my wife 's hand against my shoulder . I was not alone at all . I could not look up , so ashamed with this fit , coughing up the tears . I was so ashamed Britta should see me prone over a redhaired dilettante . I leaned more into the nubbed pink fabric . I turned away . She should never see me like this , never , not this friend . But I felt her other hand against my arm , and then her cold face beside mine . She did not hold me but floated next to me , silent . We said nothing , and never spoke of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my wet face and that smell of eucalyptus strong again , I knew there was a part of me , the greater part , which would endure . <p> We lived on Meeting Street long after graduation . In 1972 , I was still working at the Brown Alumni Center . It was good enough , and Britta went back to school so she could open up a psychology practice . I heard Marshall went to Boston to work for his father for a while , but after a year he came back to Providence , bought a house near ours . A pink house-it showed how much he needed to be near , that he would buy a pink house . I know now he planned his day to run into me , just catch my eye outside the center , and after a while I spoke cordially to him . In those conversations he was confident , talking about law school at what we considered a lesser college in the area , applying to a better school , by which he meant a better name . And one day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky was bright around his face . I remember it made Marshall the focus of the air , with sky bent to his eyes like that eerie creme de menthe the night I kissed him . <p> And Britta had taken a more steady lover , a French woman named Nathalie who worked as a designer . I will admit I never liked her much . She was very quiet . She had a habit of sitting and listening to Britta and me jabber away , just sitting with the pink tip of her tongue sticking out between her lips , the way you see older cats do . But Britta loved something about her . I heard my wife laughing in her bedroom when Nathalie came over , but never saw this part of her lover myself . When Nathalie cooked her sacred cassoulets , Britta watched her from the kitchen doorway with a rapt , patient gaze , as if her lover were a book she read for pleasure . We never know what friends see in their lovers . We always expect they will see what they see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we hate in friends ' lovers is a hoard of private moments we thought we would inherit . <p> She left Britta after some years . I forgot to say she was a married woman , and she decided it was her husband she really loved . Britta and I never spoke of it , but about a week afterwards , I took her to Boston to see her favorite place : the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum . The idea of visiting an old dead woman 's house just to see her paintings and her giant pink courtyard made me queasy , but I went for Britta . Marshall , visiting Harvard Law , joined us at the blunt medieval entrance . Britta said she wanted to see one particular painting , " The Birth of Athena , " and we toured the balconied , decorated corridors until we came into a red silk room , silver chalices against the window catching sun , paintings all around us in leafy gilt frames , hung with wires from the molding , every one on them entitled " The Birth of Athena . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her hands clasped . Then she pinched her lips together and looked at me and Marshall wideeyed . I think her loudness made me furious . That must have amused her even more , because she walked up to one of the paintings , dark foliage with a gleaming white god clutching his head . <p> " Now here , " she said seriously , " here we have a Grecian forest , and what 's happening is there 's this crack in Zeus 's skull , and who pops out of it is Athena . " Britta walked to a painting next to it , bright green . <p> " This one 's a little different , " she said , considering it . " This one 's about Athena popping out of Zeus 's skull . " <p> Then Marshall burst out in high laughter . I turned , surprised . Marshall was not one to laugh in public places , and I saw for really the first time that Britta and Marshall knew something I did n't . My lover pointed to a cartoon below the painting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " because it 's very unique . It 's about this skull , you see . " <p> " Is it Zeus 's ? " she asked . <p> " And Athena pops out . " <p> They snickered together , and a gold-buttoned guard came over . I turned away , delighted but ashamed to cause a scene in such a sacred place : a home , and a museum . The guard made us move along into the courtyard , my wife and lover arm in arm , unable to stop laughing at a joke I did n't quite understand . Britta wore a black jumpsuit and a wide black straw hat , which she held to her head as they strode past the yellow roses . There was a blueberry bush , and Marshall stood still as Britta moved slowly toward it . I do n't know why he stopped-maybe he knew to let her walk on . <p> He did not look back at me . It was not our moment together watching her . It was his moment , seeing in her some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never thought of after years seeing her with her occult necklaces , batting at the mosquito netting of her bed , and giggling as if love could not be squandered . <p> So we watched her walk into the blueberries . A tulip tree shaded her there , and she stood inside that shadow , turning slowly and taking in the peeling pink on the museum 's walls . I admired her , absorbed in the circle she was creating as slowly as a blackeyed Susan might spread its petals . The crowd around us was giddy with noise , but the main sound I remember was the clicking of her shoes and the buzzing of the heat that day . <p> I walked over to her . Marshall finally looked at me . I caught his eye , and he seemed to be examining me , the black-haired man , and not critically . As if I 'd shown him some new talent in marrying such a woman . <p> " You all right ? " I asked my wife when I reached her . <p> She stopped at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth which I knew was her fake one , though it was beautiful . <p> " Why ? Yes . " <p> " You want to leave ? " <p> She sounded oddly relieved . She took off her hat and looked up into that one tulip tree in this city museum . " No , this is nice . I was just thinking . " Britta picked a berry off the bush and put it in her mouth . She quickly removed it and made a face . " These blueberries are terrible ! " <p> " They 're still green , darling . " <p> She glared at the tiny fruit in her hand , then threw it away and blinked at me . " So they are , darling . " <p> Marshall came up behind me . He put his hand in my coat pocket . It was one of our secret signs of intimacy , as if he were searching my coat , when really it meant : Here I am . <p> " She loved you , Britta , " was what he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know he saw those things in people . <p> " No , " she said . " You can only love one at a time . Apparently it 's a rule . Like in chess . " <p> " Britta , ' I tried , " Nathalie was n't really right , and you know . . " <p> She put her hat back on and interrupted , " No , it 's fine . It 's not a big deal , really . Let 's go back and see the dungeon : ' She flicked a smile and walked past me and my lover into the sunlight . <p> " Britta . . " <p> She turned around and faced us , faced me , both hands holding her hat against the wind . Her mouth broke down right then , just snapped in two like a twig . We all simply stood there , and she shuddered . I watched her pain pooling out into her face , her shaking hand moving to wipe her cheek , and she stared at me with the fear we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she held me , smelling of eucalyptus , on another bright , sad day . <p> " Here 's something I want , " she said , moving her head from Marshall to me . " If we never see each other again , we should still all meet every year right here , " she said , tapping the table , " in the courtyard . " <p> " No , " Marshall said , glancing at me , " in the Birth of Athena ' room . " <p> Britta laughed and said , " Oh , yes , yes . But they only hang the paintings on off-years , so every other year , then . " <p> " When ? " I asked at last . <p> " Today , " Britta said , raising her eyebrows , " on your birthday , darling . " <p> " But we 're not going anywhere , Britta . We see each other every day . " <p> She put her hands out in honesty , and the hat got away from her . I ran out after it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow roses . I pulled it from the thorns , and Britta was laughing to Marshall again , arms tight around herself , eyes closed , face sideways to the light , which made her golden , valuable , alone . <p> Every two years we still met at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum . We did not go all together , of course . We pretended for that day ( my birthday ) we had lost each other in the span of years , the three of us who knew each other so well , we could imitate any of our laughs , and each loitered in the " Birth of Athena " room , staring benignly at a painting until someone finally recognized another and screamed their name aloud in delight ( Britta recognizing Marshall the first time , Marshall seeing me the next ) . Then there would be more screams as I joined in the reunion , and for all the guards knew , it was really the most astounding coincidence . <p> And so it went for years . Those ridiculous meetings in the museum marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alumni Center , which brought more and more of the same , well-broughtup men and , in 1975 , women through my doors . I barely noticed the changes at Brown , either , except the one time a rally walked by my window . In that old brownstone building , the windows were drooping glass , so at first I could n't make out the words on their signs . Then I saw one in pink : " Gay Is Good . " I sat immediately back at my desk , looking to make sure my door was closed . I felt I had witnessed an obscene act , a prurient display shown to me without my wish or consent . I felt breathless and ill , and put my head on the desk . They were chanting something , too , which , luckily , the paneled walls muffled into a harmless rhythm . I concentrated then on that rhythm and tried to breathe along with it , get myself back to the man I had been five minutes before , and not until the sounds passed down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I regained myself . <p> That was 1977 . It was the year Marshall moved to Boston . He was finishing Harvard now , and had no time for Providence commutes . Instead , he or I drove to the other city on weekends , or met together on Cape Cod or Mystic at the Aquarium . These visits also meant my time with Britta was separate from my time with Marshall . My lover and I took more cold , stony walks on beaches . He was growing more serious as years went on . His father was already dead , and I saw something tempting him . It was not another man-that was past-but the temptation to tell his mother about me , his male lover , and let all this fall to rest . We never spoke of it , but I tried with every clench of his hand not to change things . I liked things as they were . I still like most things as they are-my father taught me this adaptability , this cowardice . <p> A hurricane came that year to the East Coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ female hurricane . Britta and I were bored with it at first . It distressed the routines we had developed , and I see we were turning slowly into those practical adults who hated the snow because of driving , hated staying out at night because it was hard to see in the dim light , hated most disturbances that were no longer new . So we hated taping up all the windows and pulling the shutters . She was particularly grouchy in the matronly , quilted robe my mother had bought her . But then , when Britta found a hurricane lamp and lit it , and the soot blew out and blackened her face , we laughed as we had as college kids . <p> I asked , " What is this , minstrel hour suddenly ? " " You are a racist , darling . " <p> The lights flickered . " Clean yourself up . We have to get a fire going , or do you just want to go to sleep ? " <p> Her eyes widened in shock . " Oh , no ! Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to stay up all night tonight , on a hurricane night . " <p> I said we should read to each other . Usually she liked that . She shook her head . <p> " No . We 're going to do what I want to do . This is n't Marshall you 're with tonight . We do n't have to arm wrestle to have a good time . You 're a gay man , after all , no matter what you think : ' <p> She took me upstairs to her room and gave me her peacock kimono . She told me to strip down and put it on while she washed off the soot . She walked out of the room with the lantern , and I was left with just my dim candle there , in her room with Chinese coins strung along the mirror , striped masks on the walls . I stripped naked and put on her girlish robe . Marshall hated robes and girlish things on me . Shame , again , always that . <p> Britta came back , wearing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then I realized it was n't a nightgown . It was her wedding dress . She put her hand to her mouth , then held it out as if to stop me . " Perfect , " she said . " You look perfect . Now , just follow me . " She grabbed a bag and a book from her dresser and blinked her glassy eyes for me to come . <p> Down at the fire , she made me rub sage oil in my hair and tie it up with a towel-I must have looked like a faggot then , but I was letting her control me that night . I made her wear her blue clay mask , and so we were both ridiculous . She was letting me see at last the kind of life we would have led if our hearts had been otherwise . <p> We read messages from a plastic Ouija board she had , and she swore she was n't cheating when it spelled out names of men I 'd had crushes on long , long before . Men who now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ messages professed undying passion . They told of my innocence . Britta , or I could believe some ghost she found , told me stories I needed about myself . <p> She threw my I Ching . She told me a narrow river opened onto a lake , that I would cross the dam onto an open space . Her own fortune involved a girl with a package , and she read its meaning secretly to herself . She sat cross-legged before the fire . I could see more of her body than I ever had . She was gaining weight . But there was something newly compassionate in her larger body , the way her breasts now rested on her skin-I could see them beneath the thin fabric when she threw the fiery copper coins . I wonder what my older body looked like to her . Sometimes I wonder if she was in love with me . <p> She slept in my bed that night . It was in the corner of the house , safe from the hurricane . The lamp was on all night , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well have been off for all the darkness in the room . Once , I woke up , and the kimono had come undone-I lay naked on my half of the bed , and she was turned towards the wall , so I let the green night glow over me and imagined this was marriage , this was love , and the person asleep , smelling of sage oil , was a lipsticked man in silk . A man who knew me naked , green in the night , listening . And that all this was perfect . <p> In 1980 , a friend got me a job offer in the Alumni Center at Harvard . I had n't even told Britta that I was looking around , and at the time I told myself I was n't serious , anyway , so I need n't get her involved . But I told Marshall . Marshall knew about every step , every college I talked to in Boston . I think he knew what would happen , even then . Living in a larger city , a liberal one , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that freed him after his mother died and that allowed him to live without pretense . And he changed . People at his law firm knew about our relationship , relatives , old friends . It was 1980 , a unique moment in America . Those years in the late seventies when I was searching , he must have smiled to himself , thinking of my old-fashioned , ridiculous situation . <p> I finally talked to Britta in the fall , a rainy late afternoon . She was home from her practice and lay on the white divan , reading Harper 's and eating potato chips from a garish bag . A white candle lay flickering next to her . Her hair was still feathered blond , but lighter at the temples , as if faded from so many years in sun . We were thirty-six . <p> " Honey , " I said , sitting down in the armchair , " I have a great job offer . " <p> She looked up , her face wide open . " Really ? Oh , that 's fantastic ! Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chip in her mouth , and it crackled . <p> " It 's in Boston : ' <p> Her face considered this . She ate more chips . " That 's fine . I 'm bored of this place , really . We should have packed our bags years ago , and . . . , " she said , pointing her finger , " you 'll be closer to Marshall . This is perfect . " <p> " Marshall wants me to live with him . " <p> She closed her eyes and rubbed a finger over the lids , perhaps to be more awake . " Oh , " she said as she did this . " So that 's what this about . " <p> " I was shocked , " I said . " I did n't want to , I do n't want to , but there 's this part of me . . <p> " That really does . I know , Paul . " <p> " And it 's bigger than I thought . " I leaned over and held my hands loosely together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , wanting to skip past the next impossible sentence : " Maybe it 's time . " <p> She put her hand to her mouth , which was a movement I could not read . She wiped the crumbs from her navy skirt . <p> " It is time , " she said . <p> I waited , saying nothing . <p> " We both knew this was to make life easier . And now it 's silly , is n't it ? " She nodded , agreeing with herself . " Being married ? Is n't it ? " <p> I could n't nod , but I did smile . <p> She kept talking . These were not the exact words we said to each other that afternoon-my memory is never perfect . I do n't usually remember her in quotations , anyway . What I remember is how we talked in this way , all that afternoon , as if it were a cocktail party we were canceling and not a life . <p> So she said , " Now I have to come up with something else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good thing . We 've been stuck . " <p> " We have been , " I said . <p> " Being stuck is comforting , is n't it ? " <p> And I know I did n't feel that way at all . I was forcing myself to be sad and serious , but inside me I was thrilled to live with Marshall and change my life . I am ashamed to say I wanted Britta to smile and pack her things , to come up with something which would make this dull conversation end , so I said a common thing : " It 's been wonderful . " <p> She sat with her hand on her chin , looking up at the ceiling . She had long ago grown her real eyebrows in , and they were dark and thin . Her neck was half-shadowed , just like Marshall 's on that night on Beacon Hill when none of us knew what our playful facades would make of our lives . <p> " It is time , " she repeated , as if trying it on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " What are you going to do ? " <p> " Well , " she said quietly . " I think once I wanted to live on an island . Did n't I ? Was n't there an island ? What was that ? " <p> Now she did make me laugh-it could have been relief . " You said you wanted to be a gilded white scorpion . " <p> " Really ? " she asked , staring grinning at me . " A scorpion ? Right , be a wicked woman on a Caribbean island . Would n't that be something ? " My wife looked at me and I could almost imagine it . <p> Later , she told me firmly , " But this is lucky . This is very lucky . " <p> These were the kinds of things we said . But I ca n't picture us saying them . All I see is my wife talking in that dim , streaked light , leaning into the cushions and-I 'm sure she did n't know she did this-drawing on her forehead with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was n't what I wanted , but sketching those invisible pictures on her skin . What I remember best is that . Not much , just that . <p> It only took Britta a month to pack what she wanted , which was n't much . She quickly closed her practice and sent her clients to a friend , wrapped up the paintings she loved , only three , her clothes , some jewelry . I walked behind her , begging her to take things , but she told me , " Anyone who ca n't fit her life into two suitcases is stuck forever . " <p> The day she left , I remember she took a long shower , and I tried to shove things into the crevices of her bags : my grandfather 's pocket watch , my mother 's diamond ring , a first edition Dorothy Parker . I wanted to give it all to her because I felt she was hiding behind this adventure , escaping the grief at my selfish act . I was so guilty at the thought of being happy up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over whose china got put in the cabinet . But she must have known-there is n't much to do with friends who leave . Just these rituals of packing , but you ca n't say anything to keep him there . You can only repeat that once you drugged his tea . <p> My wife , Britta , came out of her room in her traveling clothes : black dress , red jacket , and , over her arm , the trenchcoat she claimed had always saved her . The hollow Celtic necklace lay around her throat , jingling hope , and she walked to me as she pulled on a silver bracelet . <p> " I 'll send you a card from the island when I get there , " she said confidently . " I think the phone 's too expensive . Then you 'll write to me . " <p> " Of course I will , " I said . " Are you crazy ? Of course . " <p> " And " she said , then let out a sharp laugh , " will you and Marshall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " You still want to do that ? " <p> She pouted and shook her wrist to let the bracelet settle . " Anyway , I 'll be there . " <p> " Then I 'll be there . " <p> Britta started to put the trenchcoat on . Frost was on the windows that morning , and the last leaves on the maple tree looked frozen , thick as wax . <p> " I saw a ghost last night , " she told me , one arm in the coat . " I think it must have been the maid or the governess . She was in the attic-what was I doing in the attic at that hour , even I do n't know-and all green . A green ghost , can you imagine ? I watched her for a little while , picking up invisible things and putting them back down , things that must have been here a long time ago . It was fun figuring out what they were , like I think one was a humidor . " She looked down to pull her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and alive . " She was afraid she 'd forgotten something . Afraid she 'd left something important behind . " I caught her calm look in the mirror . <p> I heard a horn outside , and the cab was there . <p> " Oh ! " she said , frantically picking up leather bags with too many straps . " Case in point ! I left my lipstick in the upstairs bathroom ! I need it , I ca n't live without it . Put me on a desert island , and I 'd trade the two books I brought for lipstick . " <p> I put up one finger , then ran out and up the staircase , which creaked at each pounding step . On the sink was a gold tube of that garish red which had embarrassed me for years , the red of dirty stories and her Dutch island and of the silk-lined museum room . I ran downstairs with it and saw the bags were gone . <p> I glimpsed out the window just a tumble of trenchcoat into the cab , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britta , once again , no goodbye . <p> Today in the courtyard , as I wish myself a happy fortieth birthday , as I stare at the green blueberries , I know Britta might not be coming . It 's been hard to contact her for two years now . She did go to Saint Eustatius , and she bought land there from an old dying man . She wrote lots of letters then , all about the insane things she saw there , the governor who was a tyrant , the rich white people on the hill hoarding a pile of wood , which on the island was like gold , her travails building a house of gingerbread and jalousies . <p> Marshall and I did n't show up here in 1982 . There was so much going on at the time : living together became sometimes more unspoken hostility than love , and I changed jobs to MIT and had to go home to my father 's funeral . That birthday passed unnoticed . Marshall still lives on Beacon Hill , and I now live south of there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now on the street-but I know his fright at middle age has brought other men into our old apartment . And the notes from Britta have been brief , businesslike . <p> That morning when she left our yellow house on Meeting Street , I walked outside in the October cold and saw the cab drive off , watched long after as the sun began to rise and make the brittle ice on the lilac bush glitter and break off . I sat down on that square wood porch , beneath the peeling columns , and could not think of anything to think . I 'd given everything away and not even seen it . All the week before , I had been eager as a boy , excited to move up to Boston , experience the warm change my life would make , and never realized what I thought had weighed me down was simply love . I had sent away the one person I really loved , and made myself think it was a kind of freedom , and now I saw the empty space this freedom revealed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as before , and there was no excuse this time for ugliness . I did n't coax the tears with self-pity or remembrance ; they just filled me . A little boy wearing a birthday hat walked by , and he stared at me weeping with no consolation now . I thought he might give me the shining present he held , but he gripped it tighter and moved on . All my muscles gnawed at me and shook . I became angry with my body for betraying me , and I gritted my teeth as I trembled with more tears . <p> It did no good . So I let go . My hands fell to the cold white wood , and I let go , and the pain of losing all those years moved over me like a warm sun . <p> The courtyard here is skylit and warm , because it is spring , and damask roses , century plants , and palm trees grow here in their careful rows . All the rooms look onto this courtyard , and I 'm searching one Moroccan window for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guards in perhaps white island cotton robes , or a gold-threaded turban . She wears a hollow silver necklace and a kind of brave compassion . You 'll recognize her laugh . <p> There 's a red jacket leaning to the window . It begins a loud , annoying tapping noise against the ancient glass until a goldbuttoned man takes her arm and mouths irritation . A flash goes off nearby-someone taking a picture-and the guard leaves her again . The red jacket returns , slides open the lock , and swings out the window with a snow of black paint . I jump up at my wife 's laughing face , and thank God , thank God . <p> 
##1003636 The man at her door was bald and wore a blue windbreaker . She had asked him twice what he wanted , but he had only said , " Are you Emily Fletcher ? " as if he knew she was , but needed confirmation . <p> It struck her from the man 's salutary tone that she might have won something-an envelope was about to be handed over with a check inside for a million dollars . She was sixty-five years old . It was about time . <p> " Yes , " she said , and heard her tone cascading downward , as if she were stepping onto an unsteady footbridge over a high mountain pass . The man looked harmless enough , there in the doorway . On closer observation he seemed less sure of himself , as if he could n't quite fathom why he was there . So many things had seemed unfathomable since her husband 's recent death that she 'd begun to accept " unfathomable " as an ongoing state . <p> Emily suddenly remembered she 'd left Hanson , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her three phone calls to get a return call from him , and now the dollars were ticking away while she stood there with this awkward stranger . She looked him over again and felt the moment seize her in which women hurriedly judge a man safe with the scantest evidence-that split second in which they lunge past fears into a hastily assumed and unreliable security . <p> " Please step inside , " Emily said . " I wo n't be a minute . " She moved back to allow the man into the entry , then shut the door behind him and automatically turned the deadbolt . She knew it was crazy , to lock people in after she 'd locked them out , but at least no one else would come in . She 'd been interrupted by the telephone as she 'd been taking a quilt from its shipping package . She had draped the gift from her sister across the back of a hall chair . She left the man standing as if he 'd come to a halt before the flag of some unknown nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odd sensation of being in two places at once . She heard her voice going out over the phone lines , but she was also uneasily aware that her side of the conversation was entering the acutely attentive but uncommunicative head of the stranger in her entryway . <p> " Nyal spent a month in Italy while the house was under construction , but it was n't a vacation ! " she said to Hanson . " Martin tells me this woman called him before his father died . " She revealed this almost involuntarily . Martin was their son , and she had confided unnecessarily to the lawyer during their last discussion that she feared Martin was a womanizer . She hated how she found herself blurting the most personal things to the business people she dealt with now . " It was while Nyal was very ill , and the woman must have intended to put pressure on him by calling Martin . " She paused here to calculate the echo factor of the stranger 's overhearing this last piece of information . Though what did it really matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these fragments of her life . Hanson 's incisive voice , heading for the crux of the matter , began impatiently sweeping aside what he seemed to consider mere female baggage . <p> " The legal issue is : did your husband modify , use , or appropriate another man 's house design ? And if so , is that man 's widow entitled to recompense ? The statute of limitations unfortunately has not run out on this . You 're further involved because Nyal completed this job under the business partnership you both formed to reduce his tax liability . You signed off on this work and took payment with him in the partnership . " <p> " I recall something about it , " Emily said . " But Nyal took care of all that . " She 'd signed whatever Nyal had asked her to sign . At the time they 'd formed the partnership , paper had flown by with blizzard force . But , as representative of her husband 's estate and also in her tutelary capacity as his surviving business partner , she would now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any action . The other woman , also a widow , and representing her own deceased husband 's estate in Rome , would be the plaintiff . On his behalf , she claimed part ownership in a house design . Nyal had only been asked to modify the design . The plans had resulted in a construction in Italy which Emily had never seen , but which her husband had supervised . Both men who 'd contributed to its design were now dead-her husband from cancer and the architect named Riccardo from a stroke in Rome some ten months previous . <p> During the final months of her own husband 's illness , Emily had been aware of murmurings from the widow in Rome , who believed Nyal owed her payment for Riccardo 's original design . Ultimately a letter had arrived , full of allegations . And Nyal , on his sickbed , had reasserted it was nonsense . Riccardo himself had invited him to modify the plan . Riccardo 's widow knew this all very well . It was unfortunate Riccardo was n't alive to corroborate it . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they need n't hire a lawyer in Rome . <p> For a time , Nyal seemed to have been right . They 'd had their hands full , with people coming to visit and pay their respects , once it became known that Nyal 's cancer was no longer in remission . Also , there was the finishing work on plans for the ecological center . Nyal had been the lead architect , and this project had been his final passion . All else had been swept aside so he could concentrate his remaining energies . The strange Italian murmuring had become inaudible , all but forgotten . Now Hanson informed her that yet another letter had arrived , one which framed the complaint so aggressively , he suspected it was preliminary to a suit . <p> " We may need to get representation in Rome for the estate and for you as well , if she decides to press the matter , " Hanson said . Emily tried to gauge the emphasis he was putting on the " if . " Why was her lawyer so lackluster , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the meaning lay in his sentences . Since her husband 's death , she had craved emotion in all her communications . This lawyer was an ongoing disappointment in this regard . <p> " Rome ? " she heard herself saying , like a word spoken aloud in a dream . It was as well to say Jakarta or Bandar Seri Begawan . The only personal connection she 'd had with Rome , other than her late husband 's sojourn there , was having avoided the city while she 'd traveled alone as a young woman in Europe . She had pointedly not gone to Italy when she 'd heard that Italian men randomly and impulsively pinched women . <p> " Do you think I 'll have to go to Rome ? " <p> " It 's possible , " Hanson said . " But worse things have happened than a trip to Rome . " Emily took note of a sound in the entryway and remembered the unknown man who , by now , must certainly have become restive . He might be deciding to go without having handed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if Nyal were in the house . Had he been there during the time prior to his illness , he would have heard the man at the door and come down . A mere two weeks had passed since his death , and the house seemed swollen and randomly eruptive . At times it pulsed with an absence that was a kind of presence , a hum of consciousness that ran parallel to her own movements in the rooms . <p> " I 'm glad Nyal did n't have to bear this , " she found herself saying to Hanson , as if Nyal could still somehow overhear . But what she really meant was that she was sorry she was having to bear it alone . " I have to go . There 's someone here , " she said , allowing a provocative edge to slip into her voice . They agreed to speak later . She paused a moment before hanging up , hoping Hanson would give a small reassurance that this trouble was likely to subside , but he gave none . <p> She hung up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some still trembling fiber of her dead husband 's actions had brought them into an unfamiliar alliance . Why had he taken on the project of a house in a foreign country ? This Riccardosomeone he 'd known from his college days who 'd married and settled in Italy-he 'd involved Nyal , brought him in to solve an impasse on a project he 'd begun . She only vaguely recalled . Nyal 's expertise in the particular building materials had been important . But also something to do with an inflexible situation . Now some inflexible element had acquired another impetus . It was hardly conceivable that this had gotten so out of hand . <p> When she returned to the entryway she found the casually dressed , rather timorous man examining the quilt . Black arrowhead-like sets of V 's dovetailed down the white fabric . There was something almost cruel about the pattern , but she identified with its pain-in-flight quality . <p> " It 's the Widow 's Quilt , ' a nineteenth-century pattern , " she said to the man . " But in the quilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " A lot of work there , " the man said quietly , raising his eyes to her with what seemed a sepulchral gaze . He let the quilt edge slip from his fingers . <p> " I do n't know quite where to use it . It 's single-bed size . " She felt at once she 'd volunteered too much in speaking of a bed to a man she did n't know . She noticed him pull nervously on his jacket zipper , running it a short way down , then up toward his Adam 's apple . There was a wedding ring on his hand . She felt herself drop her guard another notch . <p> " I have something to give you , " the man said . The insupportable idea of the prize envelope fluttered tantalizingly again through Emily 's mind . If it were to happen , it was a pity Nyal would miss it , she thought , characteristically undercutting anticipation with disappointment . The man definitively unzipped the jacket and reached inside to his shirt breast pocket . Next he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and flipped it open to reveal a gold star on a dark velvet backing . It was a badge . It seemed the man was some sort of official . <p> " I 'm a United States Deputy Marshal , " he said , expertly returning the badge to his breast pocket . " And since you are Emily Fletcher , I have papers to leave with you . You 'll need to sign , just to acknowledge you received them . " He reached farther inside his jacket and brought forth a sheaf of official documents and handed them to her . She could see that everything , except the receipt form , was in another language . <p> " If you 'd just sign here , please , Mrs. Fletcher , " the man , said without the slightest doubt in his manner that she would comply . He now had the air of someone for whom these matters were beneath notice . He produced a black pen and handed it to her . She followed his index finger to a signature line , under which she saw her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gold star . What exactly was a deputy marshal ? She felt unable to speak the question aloud . To ask could invite a revelation as to the seriousness of the matter . Was she about to be arrested ? She wanted to flee her own house . <p> She folded back the signature page and quickly scanned the document for clues . It was in Italian , she confirmed from the legal address in Rome . Here , then , were the very documents her lawyer had feared were on the way . The word " press " came back from Hanson 's characterization of what the aggrieved woman might do . She might " press on with things . " A sexual verb , Emily thought . So here the woman was , indeed . Pressing on . It struck her oddly that the coincidence of her lawyer 's warning had merged into the arrival of the process server . It carried an eerie resonance , as if something awful were masquerading as normal , a thought she had experienced most poignantly at the moment of Nyal 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rush , had been so cousined to a sigh . <p> Martin had said that when the woman telephoned three weeks ago , she 'd claimed Nyal had once given her the number " in case I ever needed to reach your father . " She 'd informed Martin she would soon be taking the " necessary steps . " Evidently it had not deterred the woman to learn from Martin that Nyal was terminally ill . Only after Nyal 's death had Martin told Emily about having received this puzzling call . Maybe the woman , even now , believed and intended that her letters , followed by the serving of papers , would catch Nyal on the brink of his death . What sort of woman would do such a thing ? She never wanted to become such a woman . <p> Emily held the papers and stared at her own name-again , the feeling of forces conjoining , of her consciousness swarmed with unsought intensity . She wanted to be rid of this man as quickly as possible . She moved her hand through the deft strokes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband 's death , she and their son had only once again referred to the woman in Italy . <p> " She can claim anything she likes , now that your father 's dead , " Emily had said . " She could claim they 'd had an affair and that he promised her the moon ! " The remark had flown out of her , and she 'd reveled briefly in the absurdity of its fictional self-inflicted wound , or perhaps the wound had been meant indirectly for Martin . " To call you-she seems desperate , " Emily said . Her son dismissed the woman as the sort of person who 's delusional , who has nothing fruitful to do with her life , so she runs around , trying to extort money and to get attention by threatening to sue . He 'd met this type , he said , in his job as an insurance adjuster . Martin was forty-three , had a darling third wife and five children from his two previous marriages . He loved to evaluate propositions , buildings , objects , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into contact . Emily knew all this without surrendering affection for him . The more untrue he 'd been to his wives , the more attentive and solicitous he had tended to be toward her . It consoled her now that he seemed to give no credence to this woman 's claims . <p> " I 'm sorry , " the bald man said , lifting the stapled pages to yet another signature page . " Just here on the duplicate , if you 'd be so good : ' He pointed to a red X near a blank . Emily was n't at all sure she should be signing for these papers , but doing so was strangely as simple as the fact that the pen was in her hand . She signed again , then without replacing the cap , handed the pen back to the man . His hands , like her own , were trembling . He was also finding the encounter stressful . <p> " Now , " he said , and glanced pointedly toward the living room . " Could you tell me , please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked in the opposite direction toward the kitchen . " Or has he relocated ? " This second question startled her in the possibilities it opened up . She thought of the woman 's audacity in having telephoned her son , the invasiveness of her having insinuated a dispute into such a time , when her husband 's life had been reaching its final days and hours . And now this woman , who should have been in mourning , like herself , had propelled a process server into her entryway . There had obviously been some delay in the arrival of the papers , which must have been in the works prior to Nyal 's death . The U.S. Deputy Marshal probably did not read Italian and had no idea what this was about . He was restless and only half-satisfied in his accomplishment . He tucked the signed receipts inside his jacket , allowing Emily to retain the sheaf of paper in Italian . Then he regarded her , as if she were withholding something . He seemed precariously on the verge of becoming less courteous . A set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emily 's mind was speeding through the town . She could picture exactly where her husband lay-the freshly disturbed plot which overlooked the town at its eastern edge . There was only a large evergreen wreath at the head of his grave with " Nyal " and " Beloved Husband &; Father " in gold lettering on wide strands of velvet ribbon . It would be months before she arranged for the stone and decided what to inscribe on it , but there was a poem she already had in mind . It was a tanka by the Japanese poet Basho-whose poem was modeled on yet another poem sent by a woman to a man after their first love-meeting . She might use only the first three lines : <p> Was it you who came Or was it I who wentI do not remember . <p> She approved of the casualness of these lines , how they held a definitive absence in suspension , as some mere coming or going . The words would have yet another dimension , she realized , when her own remains eventually entered the plot beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were still ongoing between them . Even while the poem subtracted their " remembering , " it would insist on memory all the more for anyone who paused before the stone . But most of all , she agreed with how the words cast away life and death in one fell swoop . There was something at once simple and expansive in that motion . <p> " Yes , my husband has relocated , " she said , bringing her attention back to the man . It occurred to her that although she had no control over the serving of these papers , she did hold sway over the exact moment in which she stood . <p> " Would you be so kind as to tell me where I might find Mr. Fletcher , " the bald man said . <p> " Certainly , " Emily said . She spoke clearly and decisively . " I 'd be glad to help you find my husband . " The man was clearly taken aback by her cooperativeness , as if he 'd expected to be rudely dismissed . He shifted the remaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wedding ring over the top of his pale head and let it drop . He then shifted his feet in a maneuver that brought him backwards and into contact with the widow 's quilt . It was likely he 'd experienced harsh treatment many times . His demeanor , she saw , had visibly softened when she said she would help . He did not smile , but dropped his shoulders , which had been held high and rather formally . <p> " There 's a very nice view of the town where my husband has landed , " Emily said . She disliked the casual implication of " landed " since she and Martin had carefully chosen the site . Nonetheless , she was determined to continue in this fashion , to reveal exactly where her husband was . <p> " Oh , very good , " the man said . He resituated the sheaf of documents meant for her husband inside his jacket , then plunged a hand into his trouser pocket , jingling some loose change , no doubt an unconscious expression of delight at the surrender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on First , past the bowling alley and down Race until you come to Caroline , " she directed . The man took a small notebook from a side jacket pocket and began to scribble . " Then turn right and continue past the hospital , " Emily continued . " You 'll approach some grassy fields , then go up a steep hill . At the top you 'll find the development you 're looking for . " To call a graveyard a " development " would never have occurred to her , but she supposed death was a development . Still , her husband 's death was beyond the word in such a physically challenging way that she felt an involuntary shiver run through her . <p> " I imagine there 's a house number , " the man said . <p> " If you need assistance to find exactly where Mr. Fletcher 's situated , " Emily said , " ask at the little white house just inside the gate . There 's someone on duty until five p.m . " <p> Emily thought she 'd deflected the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his watch , and Emily automatically checked her own . She saw that only half an hour remained for the man to get further help in finding her husband . He slipped the notebook with the instructions back into his side pocket . <p> " You 've been most cooperative , " he said , and glanced uncomprehendingly at the ferocious black darts of the Widow 's Quilt which , as he brushed against it , seemed to be jutting directly into him . For a moment she thought crazily that , in his mute exuberance , he intended to embrace her . The idea made her quake , as when he 'd flashed his deputy marshal 's badge . She was relieved when he reached for the door handle and attempted to let himself out . She moved near his shoulder , turned the deadbolt , and moved back so he could pass through . On the steps he paused , turned toward her , and uttered some final sentence of courtesy , then crossed the driveway to his white Volvo . She was taking pleasure in the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following her directions , this minion of the widow in Rome . He climbed into his car , then lifted his hand in a mild wave in her direction . She did not return the gesture . <p> She was thinking of her husband now , that he could not know these unpleasant things which had befallen her since his death , strangers who wanted to use his silence to beleaguer and ensnare her . Nyal would have enjoyed how she 'd just acquitted herself . She imagined them laughing about the U.S. Deputy Marshal driving into the cemetery , hoping to be directed out of a wrong turn , asking the caretaker where Nyal Fletcher " lived . " Well , the widow in Rome had misused Emily 's husband , and now Emily would make use of her messenger . The man could stand before her husband 's wreath as long as he wanted . Maybe Emily 's circumstances would prick his heart . He might fully experience the weight of his actions that day . After all , they had each been reduced to functionaries . <p> She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathered the quilt so the darts folded against her breasts and grazed her neck . She carried it upstairs to the queen-size bed she now occupied alone . She spread the quilt out on her side . With the pattern unfurled , the bed seemed to be sliced in two , but the quilt gave her side fresh vitality . Even though it was hours before bedtime , she unbuttoned her dress , stepped out , then lifted the covers and crawled between the sheets in her slip . The added weight was an unexpected comfort . She closed her eyes , then eased her hand onto her husband 's side of the bed . It was cooler , and she realized that her cheeks , against the white pillowcase , were flushed . <p> She thought of the woman in Rome . What if ? she thought , and Emily smiled to recall the moment with Martin in which she had cast her dead husband into the woman 's arms , in a sentence uttered more as a challenge to the unlikely than a true possibility . But what would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another woman ? How casually the thought came to her . They had been married the same forty-five years . She believed they had loved each other beyond all others . She even recalled the exact site of her faith , her steadfast belief . One night before they were to go out in company , he 'd put his arms around her at the door and said , " If I should ever say anything to annoy you while we 're out , dear , ignore it , because I adore the ground you walk on . " It was gallant and wide , and no one had said anything so beautiful to her before or since . <p> Death had added another dimension to that long-ago gift . Perhaps it was death , that ultimate release from belonging , which made even the idea of infidelity seem ludicrous . She suddenly caught a glimpse of a possibility she 'd kept quietly in reserve . She wondered if all wives held aside a reserve of forgiveness for unrevealed betrayals , believing their husbands could , in some pull of opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart ? She had put aside such a reserve , she saw , without really having had to know it , until now . Yet : so what ? <p> Prior to the Italian woman 's intrusion , which had forced her to tremble in her own doorway , she 'd had no idea of the degree to which she could still volunteer acceptance of all Nyal might have been . It was really in behalf of them both that she could manage this leap . At his death she had thought mistakenly that an end had come to the growth of their earthly loving , but instead she had stepped onto unexpected terrain , where what she held precious had become even more so . In these thoughts she was able to reach herself newly , and this both surprised and enlarged her sense of Nyal and of their life together . In her heart 's reception of all her husband might have experienced , in and out of her knowledge , she saw with an ungaugable , onrushing force how deeply she 'd loved him and loved him still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so very kind , " the U.S. Deputy Marshal had said to her as he 'd gone down the porch steps . Her throat tightened now as she recalled his words . She had not been at all kind toward this man , and by now he would be realizing this . What was there in being kind when life itself and the actions of others were often monstrous ? Yet she continued to believe kindness was , when one could manage it , the ultimate checkmate , and beyond that , the one enviable gift . Yet could there be a hidden sleeve of malice inside too much kindness ? Whatever else , she 'd been true to her feeling . <p> Nyal 's silence seemed more vast than ever , and she felt included there-allowing all things to be absorbed , to coexist-fidelity and infidelity , residence and grave , coming and going . <p> By now the man had likely reached his destination . He would have come to stand before the wreath . For a moment he might have studied the name on the fluttering ribbon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and begun to walk back to his car . Perhaps he was ruefully thinking of her this very moment , of how artfully she 'd misled him . But maybe , if he had n't passed too far into disgruntlement , he might pause and look back toward the grave , realizing that , on either side of the town , they could both be faintly smiling . <p> 
##1003638 Where did I get the idea for this picture ? It was the year of El Nino-the current , I mean , and not anything else that I knew about at the time-and the meteorologists were telling us to expect strange events in the atmosphere . <p> They did n't say anything about events at home , where it had n't been good between me and my housemate , Gary , for nearly a month now , ever since one of our late-night script sessions turned into a mistaken encounter in my bedroom . Still , except for the color of the sky-low clouds , smog , the kind of weather we do n't usually advertise , especially when it comes in the middle of summer-it was kind of lovely outside that afternoon , warm , with an inviting breeze blowing up over the bluffs from the ocean . It was that same wind that pushed all the crappy air back up against the mountains east of the city , and when you drove up to the top of the road and looked down in our direction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow scrim that someone had tacked up over the hills . From that hilltop , I wound my way down into the adjoining neighborhood and threaded the car along through four or five more all the way to the mall . I did n't like driving the freeways much , because I always thought of Joan Whatshername 's heroine Maria , played by Tuesday Weld , and the way she drove and drove . That 's how you get out here-probably all over America , since I do n't feel much different about it than I did when I was living in Illinois-seeing life in terms of movies . Or a better , more truthful way to put it , seeing life as a movie . What else was I supposed to believe when I pulled into a parking space at the mall and who should drive up alongside me but my favorite actress friend Bunny ? <p> " Yo , Bee , " she said , rolling her window all the way down . She was wearing shades and had bound up her long hair in a snooda sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarette . I had n't seen her since Gary and I had gone to one of those chamber music evenings over at Milt Markowitz 's . I think she had been going out with the viola player . I remember saying to Gary , That girl looks like my little sister , Harriet-except Bunny could never live in the Chicago suburb where Harriet and her banker husband have settled , with two kids , a dog ( though no cat ) , and a little behind-the-house pond with a rowboat-but Gary was too busy flirting with the viola player himself to pay much attention . <p> " So , you ready for it ? " Bunny said , puffing out some smoke from between her teeth in that schoolgirl way-what a schoolgirl ! -that Gary had said , correctly , was so right for the part of Harmon Root , the runaway rich girl in the carnival story we were pitching . <p> I beeped shut my car and slouched over to Bunny 's window , leaning over the way you see the CHPs do on the freeway when some poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rabanne-twisted my nose into a knot . <p> " Ready for what ? " <p> " Our big dinner tonight " Bunny said . I looked blank . " You do n't remember ? Roger and Balu Maginnes ? " <p> " Shit , how could I have forgotten that ? But I did ! " What ? Was I crazy , or just depressed ? Roger and Balu were n't a pair whose invitations you took lightly-the big bald producer with the drop-dead beautiful actress wife was how I first noticed them at the evening at Milt 's house , and I remember that my heart started to flutter when I got introduced to them . <p> " I 'm amazed Gary did n't say anything , " Bunny said as I pulled back from her window and looked around at the gray-orange sky . <p> " He was lost in his new cowboy script , " I said . " Showdown at the Gay Corral . I 'm the one who should have remembered . Our big chance to pitch the carnival story again ! We thought it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself something to cheer you up , and we 'll charm them tonight . A nice shirt , maybe . That 's my thing when I 'm down . A shirt . Or maybe a scarf ? I do n't know you that well , Bee . Are you a scarf chick ? " <p> " No , " I said . " I 'm a cat person . When things get tough , I go and buy something for my Meow . " <p> " I 'm glad you like animals . " <p> " You are ? Why ? " <p> She gave me a mysterious smile and said she 'd see me tonight , and with a little wave drove off . <p> I walked slowly across the lot , a vast metal beach of gleaming sports cars and sedans , and wandered along the walkways of the mall , strolling from shop window to shop window-the leather dresses , velvet coats , platinum-rimmed eyeglasses , gloves made from the skin of antelope , emeralds and rubies in the most bizarre settings , ropes of pearls , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juice bar , drank a papaya smoothie for lunch . There was a pet store , of course , so I went in and bought a little bag of catnip on a string . Then I found another shop , where the brightly lighted window was filled with stuffed lambs , rabbits , and bears . Like a sleepwalker , I made a purchase . <p> Then I drove back the way I 'd come , the blue blaze of ocean on my horizon , the urine-colored curtain of smog behind me , and this sort of gave me hope , though for what exactly I could n't figure . <p> I wanted to share my good feeling with Gary when I got back , except that he had gone out , saying in a note left on the front table that my mother had called . <p> I took out the little gift for Meow , and tossed her the bag on the stick . It did n't take but a few seconds for her to begin tearing around with it on the rug , crazed with the scent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy , I dialed my mother 's number . <p> " I called you earlier , " she said after picking up on the first ring . <p> " I got the message , Mom . " <p> " It should n't always be my call that makes you call me . " <p> " I 'm just a wayward daughter , " I said . <p> " Do n't talk that way , Bee . If you say something , you could make it happen . " <p> " That 's sort of a primitive way of thinking , Mom . " <p> " I do n't know what you 're talking about . Tell me , have you been getting around ? " <p> " Getting around ? " <p> " Have you been meeting any nice young men ? " <p> I held the receiver at arm 's length . Outside the window , a stray gull swept from the beach on a lifting wind . It swooped past our orange tree and disappeared at an angle into an otherwise empty sky . <p> " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " because I stay home and work . With Gary . We- " <p> " Friends are friends , Bee , " she cut in , " but I do n't have to tell you that you 're not getting any- " <p> " Younger ? " <p> " If you 've heard me say this often enough to know it by heart , then you ought to know enough to believe it by now . I do n't mean to nag , darling , but just woman to woman , I have to tell you that when you get to my age , you wo n't be able to look back on your work and get much comfort from it . " <p> I took a deep breath . " You 're right . I should have some children that I can call on the phone and make miserable because I 'll be alone and pissed off at- " <p> " Please do n't speak to me that way , Bee . " <p> Another breath . " I 'm sorry . You do n't bring out the best in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , tell me , then , have you seen any movie stars lately ? You 're always telling me about seeing people like that at lunch . " <p> " You just shut off one thing and pick up another ? " <p> " I thought you wanted me to stop talking about the other thing . " <p> " I just want to have a talk with you , Mom . In a pleasant way . You know , like , How are you ? ' and How was your day ? " ' <p> " Family is n't always pleasant in that way , Bee . " <p> " So why do you want so much for me to start one ? " <p> I could hear my voice sail into the highest register . <p> I was still close to tears when Gary came in the door . He was wearing his usual jeans and thin T-shirt with his cigarettes rolled up in the right sleeve . But despite that tough-guy stuff and his wispy mustache , he had that little-lost-dog look . <p> " Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meow came tearing through the room with her catnip ball , did a roll , a leap , and another roll , tossing the ball of herbs and then catching it again before it came to a stop . <p> " My big purchase , " I said . <p> Gary looked puzzled . " Did you call your mother ? " <p> " That 's why my eyes look red . " <p> He came and peered into my face . " Ah , so .. <p> I rubbed my nose with my fist and turned away . <p> " At the mall ? " I said when I looked back at him . <p> " Uh-huh ? " <p> " I saw Bunny . " <p> His tongue slipped out from between his teeth , the way it does when he 's working on a line of dialogue and you know even before it comes out that it 's going to be a snapper . <p> " Oh , my God , that 's so dumb ! I just remembered ! But I ca n't go . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at each other when the telephone rang . <p> It was Bunny . " Better wear pants , " she said . <p> When I hung up , I turned to Gary . <p> " Did you know ? " <p> " Know ? Oh , about the ride ? " <p> I nodded . <p> " Yeah , " he said . " I mean , I knew , but then I forgot about it . Look , Bee , if you want me to go with you , I 'll break my engagement " <p> I shook my head . " I can do it myself . I just need to rest , " I said . " Before I go . " <p> And so I left him standing there-not a very nice thing , but it was what I thought I had to do . I went into the bedroom and lay down , feeling a little dizzy at the thought of what was to come . There 's one thing Prozac does , though . No dreams . At least not for me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The next thing I knew , Meow was purring furiously in my ear . I sat up to see the sky outside turned to lavender and fading crimson . " Hi , little puss , ' I said , a croak in my throat as I ran my fingers along her long back . It was late , I was sweating , but it was n't the middle of the night , so I could n't just turn over and go back to sleep . So I hauled my butt out of bed and dragged myself into the shower . In just thirty minutes , I was driving down the Ventura Freeway , heading south . The traffic began to slow , and I thought to myself , Oh , girl , here it comes , this is why I hate these roads , and then I saw the orangey flickering on the horizon and figured that someone else had bigger troubles than mine . After the next curve , I could see the dance of fire on the other side of the road , lower than the palm trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Two cars were burning like slabs of meat on a grill , and the small auxiliary fire truck that had pulled up alongside them was n't doing much to put out the flames . Inching along on my side of the freeway , those of us moving away from the accident could see the rolling lights and hear the wavering whine of more engines approaching . God help the passengers if they were still inside ! I rolled down my window and tried to look back , but our lane was moving too fast now to do more than get a good whiff of the fire . It stayed with me all the way to the restaurant , Cactus Cantina , in Burbank , surrounded on either side by stables , dark animals milling about in the corrals , steeping the air around the place with odors different from the rest of the city . <p> Two rows of faces greeted me inside the restaurant . There was Bunny , sitting alongside Roger and his beautiful blond wife . A half-dozen other couples I did n't know and Milt Markowitz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called to say you were going to be late . So I had the idea we could play the old switcheroo , " Milt spoke in that appealing Long Island nasal voice of his . " I 'm not into punishment , and I do n't know if I can make it back . " <p> Seeing my puzzled expression , Bunny piped up , " Milt rode with us , but he 'll drive your car home for you and take a taxi from there if you ride his mount back over the mountains : ' <p> " I love what she said . My mount ! My mount ! I love that word ! " Milt looked up at the papier-mache pinatas dangling from the ceiling . <p> " When you did n't show at the stables , " Bunny said , " I gave up on you . I 'm glad you remembered the restaurant . " <p> " Me , too , " I said , noticing that Roger Maginnes was smiling up at me while his wife dabbled with her spoon at some dessert . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . " I love that word . My mount ! " He paused and took a breath . " Except I had a saddle with teeth and it chewed up my tuchas . " <p> " The white Rabbit , " I said to him enigmatically as Maginnes 's wife looked over at me and I turned away to dig in my bag for the keys . <p> " The bronze-colored mount , Milt said and lifted the keys from my hand . <p> Next thing I know , people are pushing back from the table , tossing their napkins onto their used dessert plates , and Roger Maginnes is saying at the top of his voice , like a character in a picture he 's much too subtle to make , " Troop , mount up ! " I 'd missed dinner . <p> In the corral behind the restaurant , I met my mount , a chestnut mare named Madonna . As the groom held her reins , I stared at her in the light of the spots above the stable doors , feeling her edgy vitality under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went a little weak in the knees from the pungent power of her smell . The young Mexican groom motioned for me to mount , and as I hoisted myself into the stirrup , I felt his hand pushing up on my ass , and then I was sitting high in the dark , the big animal twitching menacingly beneath me . Roger Maginnes pulled up alongside me sitting atop a huge black gelding . <p> " You 've done this before , right ? " <p> " At Honey Cartwright 's house every summer when I was a girl , " I said , watching as his horse shimmied sidewise and then jerked away forward , but not before I caught a glimpse of the round white globes of the gelding 's eyes . <p> Honey ! I had n't thought of her in years , her big house north on the lakeshore , what we used to do after dark with the black grooms from the deep-city neighborhoods . Grooms ! It never occurred to me until now what richness lay in that word ! <p> The other horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved with a clatter out of the corral . <p> " Troop ! Foh-ward ! " <p> " Roger , " I called after him into the dark beyond the gate , " you should make a western ! " <p> Now , if you have ever wondered-and I myself certainly had n't before this evening -- just how a posse of folks on horseback would take a ride across Los Angeles , here is how you do it . The first thing is you cross the freeway , and you do this by means of a long dusty trail that curves away from the stables and declines gently toward the racing lights and roaring vehicles on the road and then ducks beneath the road into a long tunnel swirling with dust and clanging with the rebounding sounds of hoofbeats . This was our first ten minutes , and my mouth clogged with the thick choking clouds we kicked up as we moved along with only the faint glow of arc lamps at the far end . <p> Coming out of the tunnel was like coming up for air after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , snorting along with the horses and giving myself over to the batting rhythm of Madonna as she chugged along , bouncing me mercilessly in the saddle . I looked ahead for Roger , but all I saw was the huge rump of his mount as he and a couple of other riders took advantage of the flat stretch between the road and the hills to make their horses race . <p> " Hey-yo ! " Voices drifted back to me over the clatter of the hooves . And then we began climbing . <p> " It 's beautiful , " I called out near the crest of the trail , catching up with Bunny , who bounced along smartly atop a broad bay mare . <p> " You having fun ? " she said . <p> " I 'm having a ball . " <p> Roger just then turned his horse back toward us , and in the faint glow of the quarter moon , I could see a strange smile pass across his face . <p> " There 's that , and there 's that , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up alongside me . He pointed up at the sliver of moon and then at the trail that opened into a field of odd machines and smoking pipes poking out of the ground . <p> " What is that ? " I said , staring at this weird landscape . <p> " Methane farm , " he said . " These hills were built up out of garbage . As it decays , it gives off methane gas . " <p> " We 're riding across mountains of garbage ? " I watched now with fascination at the little puffs of smoke that burst from the ends of the buried pipes . <p> " You got to look at it another way . It 's all a metaphor , " he said . I 'd never heard anyone in the business , except for Milt , talk about anything like it was poetry . " They pile it on here , and it makes a mountain , and then we ride over it and catch the view . I mean , look at that down there , Bee : ' Roger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast ocean of illumination below us . Whatever he meant by what he said , I could n't take my eyes off that luminescent plain fluttering with bursts of bright lights here and there-in which somewhere that fire I saw on the way over or another fire in another part of the city or a fire that would burn before I knew it was adding to the glow . Our horses held fairly still , only their occasional snorts and heaving breaths clotting the air , while faintly in the distance at the bottom of the great decline , the tiniest whines of sirens and rumbling of the freeway drifted up to us . <p> " Bunny , " Roger said , " would you ride up ahead and see how they 're doing ? " <p> " Sure , pardner , " Bunny said , throwing me a strange look-the moonlight , however faint , clearly showed her arched eyebrows and puckered mouth-and then peeling away up the trail . <p> " Bee ? " Roger urged his horse closer to mine so that he could reach over and take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . <p> " Did I do something wrong ? " <p> " You 're so cool , Bee , " he said . " Loosen up a little . <p> " What are you talking about ? " <p> He got-somehow-his horse to edge even closer , so that when he leaned across his neck , it was almost as though we were sitting together on some stiff , old-fashioned upright divan and his head was nearly resting on my shoulder . <p> " Do n't misunderstand me , " he said . <p> " What ? " <p> " In my position , I could get misunderstood . There 's always girls , you know . " He nodded toward the dark , and I thought that he might have meant something about Bunny . " That 's not what this is about . " <p> " What is it about , Roger ? " <p> Madonna jittered in place , nervous to walk , I figured . Uncomfortable would n't describe what I was feeling then . <p> " Troop 's got to get moving " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So ? " <p> He tried to reach for me , but my horse backed away , spooked a little by his sudden move . <p> " Easy , girl , " he said . <p> " Who are you talking to , Roger ? " I said . <p> " Very funny , " he said , turning in his saddle and looking up the trail into the darkness where all the other riders had long disappeared . " But we should talk . " <p> " I think we should . " <p> Madonna calmed down again , and I felt so good sitting so high up on her , as still as the stillest part of the big mass of her body . <p> " I think we could talk " Roger said . " Bunny tells me that you have a treatment . " <p> " That 's right , pardner , " I said . <p> " Then we can talk . " Roger 's gelding shied just then at some invisible menace in the dark , stamping back a few paces and then letting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in that moment Madonna took it upon herself to gush out a long hot stream of particularly pungent flow , the sound of which rushed through the space between Roger and me . <p> " We 'll talk , " he said , and gave his horse a kick that sent them moving up the trail at a rapid rate of speed . <p> " Wait for me , " I called after him , digging my heels into Madonna . I might as well have been urging a statue to move . " Come on , girl ! " I shouted , kicking harder as Roger dissolved into the blackness ahead . <p> And then the dark kicked back , because at that instant these terrible cramps nearly folded me over double in the saddle , and I sat there in agony , unable to get the horse to budge . Tears rolled down my cheeks , the stink of the animal jammed all the way up my nose like slivers of bamboo under the fingernails of some victim in a thirties movie about the Orient . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone up here , and hurting . For a moment the only sound after my voice faded away was the gentle hissing of the methane tubes and the faint tumult of the city below , a whirring , shushing sound that branches make when stirred by a forceful wind . My insides twisted around knotted up . Oh , Mama ! I started to cry . Somebody please come and help me ! <p> I looked up to see mist passing before the moon and the chill of it all settling over me like the gauzy curtain before a big empty screen . <p> And then it came to me , right then and there , just what a scene it would make ! The girl , stranded out here on horseback , her guts churning-but why ? not just like me because she had cramps , though I was thankful that they arrived at last , but something else , what ? like maybe she was pregnant and going into premature labor ? but then why would she even think about going for a ride like this ? wait , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . she was carrying one man 's child-say , someone like Roger ? and wanted to marry the other , say , Gary ? but how would it go ? how would it go ? and who is she , anyway ? rich girl on her own horse ? or working girl on a rented mount ? a career girl from the Midwest , say ? who came out to work in . . . what ? not the movies , not that , but then what ? a girl my age , pretty , but not sure of herself , attractive to men but not really liking herself all that much , and she drifts into one hurtful affair after another , and she 's got some talent , sure , but there 's something inside of her , some need she has that she does n't want to admit to herself , the opposite of the wild side , of the desperate hope and chance that brought her out here , because . . . because even though it 's a cliche , she 's had to admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , and she 's not sure of either man , maybe , but she goes along with it , because it 's the business , she gives her whole life to the business , and even though things are going well , say , her mother calls and it all comes to her in the middle of the conversation just how sad she feels , you can see it on her face as she talks on the telephone , she tells herself it 's okay , it 's going to be all . right , and maybe she can have both things , the work and a family when the right guy comes along , and she thought she had found him in this young-what ? -screenwriter ? okay , okay , but I thought she was n't going to be involved in the movies ? -but say that he is a screenwriter , or a lawyer ? or what ? say he runs a restaurant ? no ! or maybe a stable , yes , a riding stable just at the foot of the Santa Monicas , a surprising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here would ever imagine , a stable in the middle of this huge city , and horses that travel in tunnels under the freeways , kicking up clouds of dust that rise into the air and fade into the smog , and say that they go out for a midnight ride , this woman and her friend , the man she loves , the man she adores , and it turns out that she 's pregnant and does n't even know it , maybe she 's just missed a period and she 's had some irregular periods in the past when she was under a lot of stress , and he tells her-what ? that he 's met someone else ? or that he 's gay ? maybe that ? which leads to the problem of the child and whether or not the man is infected , and say that the baby 's going to be HIV ? and they 're going through hell because of it ? and he decides to say the hell with it all ? and takes off on his mount ? his mount ! and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hills of garbage , calling out to him that she does n't care , that she loves him no matter what ? and in the dark she 's galloping alongthink of the scene , this scene , the dark trail , the city like an ocean all around this island made of trash-and the horse stumbles and throws her and the baby dies ? <p> " Bee ? " <p> A woman on horseback came trotting back up the trail , calling my name as she rode . <p> " Hi , " I said , giving the uncooperative Madonna another kick . But I still had trouble . <p> " You all right ? " It was Balu Maginnes . " We thought you might have fallen . " <p> " Where is everybody ? " I said . <p> " Almost back at the stable by now , I 'm sure , " she said . " Roger sent me after you . I 'm a better rider . " She reached for my reins , but I pushed her hand aside . <p> " I 'm okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " So what were you doing up here ? " <p> " Admiring the view , " I said . <p> And then suddenly she turned her horse , and Madonna began to move and followed her mount along the trail past the rest of the methane pumps and then down along the sloping ridge and into the utter darkness of the steeply descending path . My cramps returned ten times worse than before . The trail went down and down , and I dared to turn in the saddle to try and ease my pain , and looked back up to where I had been lingering , dreaming all that time . <p> I could hardly breathe by the time we reached the stables . My nose and mouth and throat were so filled with dust , and my cramps had gotten even worse . Gary was standing there , his small hands planted on his slender hips , looking more miffed than worried . Bunny was waiting with him . So was Roger Maginnes . By the time I turned my horse over to the groom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office , Roger and Balu had already gone . <p> " They said they had an early call , " Gary said . " But I could n't abandon you . " <p> " Your legs are really going to hurt in the morning , " Bunny said as she walked with us to the parking lot . <p> " And yours wo n't ? " I said . <p> " It 's just like fucking , " she said . " You have to keep in shape . " <p> Gary was staring at me . " Are you all right ? " he said once we were inside the car . <p> " Yes , I 'm fine . " <p> I tried to sleep on the drive home , but the horse smell lay too thick on me , and I sat there , eyes closed , going over and over the treatment I had imagined in the dark . Once we got to the house , I asked Gary to feed the cat while I stripped off my clothes , tossed them into the washer , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thighs resonated in the stinging water . <p> After that , I lay in bed with Meow curled up into a purring ball near my head and the stuffed lamb I had bought at the mall tucked against my rumbling stomach . Next thing I knew , Gary was in the room , saying , " Telephone . " <p> " Oh , " I said , picking up the receiver . <p> " I woke you , did n't I ? " Milt said in his nasal way . <p> " That 's all right . " <p> " I would have left a message on your machine , but I hate those things . I just wanted to say thanks in person . So , thanks . " <p> " You 're welcome ; ' I said . <p> " I 'm vell-come , " he said . " You are , " I said . I looked up at Gary , who shrugged and left the room . <p> " Am I vell-come enough to maybe take you to dinner tomorrow night ? " Milt said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , " I said . <p> " I was n't thinking about it like that , " he said . " Nobody owes anybody anything . This would just be a dinner-dinner . So ? " <p> " Milt , can I think about it ? " <p> " Okay , " he said , and I was sorry to hurt his feelings . But I was too tired to explain anything anymore that night . Though after I hung up , I lay there a while listening to Meow 's insistent breathing and the distant hum of the spin cycle on the washer . I was still awake when the next call came . <p> " Hello ? " <p> " I told you we could talk . " <p> " Roger , " I said , " it 's so late . " <p> " I do some of my best business this time of night , " he said . <p> 
##1003639 At night the wind sometimes woke him as it sliced across the . tin roof of the cabin , and he would open his eyes in darkness to find his hands gripping the bedframe . Thirty-five knots , forty knots-it was impossible not to gauge the speed of the gusts in his mind . He felt , too , the chastened shudder of a hull and the inevitable way his bones prepared themselves for a hard roll to port . The lake was a quarter mile away , beyond two ridges feathered with birch and spruce , yet he could hear her , feel her . The wind might eventually shift to the south , or it might blow itself out . Still , he never again found sleep on those nights-a cruel , honest fact of his body . He lay alert on his thin mattress , boots and slicker hanging so close he could smell them , completing his watch as he must . <p> November . A month of change , a time of vigil . The last of the leaves flared and fell away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the bay like a green sea this time of year , this far north . It happened quickly , without much warning even to him , and he 'd lived on this stretch of the eastern peninsula all of his life except when he 'd been on the lakes , or tramping the Atlantic . He cut wood . He laid in kerosene and dry goods , reorganizing supplies on the shelves of the cold porch until they made sense only to him . He repaired the roof , suffered a bitter night 's rain , repaired the roof again . He visited his sister in town , took her a face cord of mixed hardwood even though she had n't asked for it . He turned back the deer hunters who wandered east from the state forest . He studied the patterns of the crews from the power company as they did their last work of the year in his territory . It was a season of reckoning and recognition , one he liked to mull over . He was old . Preparation was the only rule left to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the shore . It was the one aimless routine he allowed himself , and it was far better , he thought , than being part of the union flotsam that washed up on waves of coffee or worse along the gangways of the Soo locks . Those were the men who could n't break their habits , or did n't know they had them to begin with . Not that he avoided every laker he ran into . He did not . He 'd taken his nephews to the locks once or twice , shared some stories with the jaw gang there . And he saw the old pissers in the Indian casinos when he went , former oilers and bosuns and mates exchanging their pension cash for lightweight tokens , their dark deck clothes replaced with golf shirts that made no sense on their bodies . He had little need for their sort of commerce . It was enough to come to the edge of the bay . Sniff at the nearly odorless water , utter the old names that gave character to its waves and the ranging grays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood some miles offshore , her bluffs a charcoal slash of shadow and spume . Often there would be a ship clearing the straits as well , and he would eye her as carefully as he dared , knowing there was a good chance he 'd recognize her , that she 'd been plying her trade when he 'd been scrambling at his . Seven hundred feet long , a thousand feet long , riding high on ballast or filled with grain , phosphates , maybe ore . There was a great deal he could tell from a glance . Yet all he really found himself studying was her silhouette and her motion , knowing she held desperate men . November , and the ice was not here yet , the gales were still howling their chorus to the north . A walk to the rocky , windwhisked shore of the bay . A savored cigarette . The rest of the day for the simpler , bracing tasks he now asked of himself . <p> He had the bulldozer out of the shed the day the boy came . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was how he explained his unreadiness when it needed to be explained . There was a locked gate between his place and the state road two miles west . No one was supposed to bother him except the Sandhursts , who used his track to get to their cottage , and maybe the Mahans , who owned a few acres along the shore to the southeast . Even his brother , Otto , did n't come out here . Too far from town , Otto said . They could talk at the shop if they needed to talk , or at their sister 's . Then the boy appeared , on foot , moving like he knew where he was going and why . He was startled and felt surprise flutter across his face like a dusky wing just before he went spiteful . <p> If the boy said hello , he never heard it . But the boy did stop walking , waiting for a moment on the wet leaves of the path , which allowed him to cut the grind of the bulldozer 's diesel to silence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did that-no noise , no heat or vital stink from the engine . The boy was dressed in a red plaid wool coat , jeans , a beaten felt hat , no gloves . He looked warm enough , though he was n't wearing any blaze orange , which made him a damn fool . Dark eyes and skin , flattish nose , wide jaw . Chippewa , maybe , though it was n't a face he recognized . If the boy was poaching , he 'd gotten half-smart and stashed his gun . If he was just wandering , he 'd made a considerable mistake . <p> He laid his crescent wrench in the toolbox bolted behind the seat of the dozer . It was the boy 's place to get nervous and speak . <p> " Came for the beaver : ' The voice was quick and casual , though deep enough to make him believe the boy was older than he looked . <p> " Do n't look like you came ready for much of anything . " He waved at the boy 's empty hands and began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any bad stories about him and the lonely way he lived in the woods . He hoped he had . " You should n't be here . " <p> " I got the permission . " The boy swung an arm down the track past the cabin . " Man called from Lansing , having trouble with too many beaver : ' <p> He understood then , enough of it . A portion of Sandhurst 's land had been flooded all spring and summer ; they 'd had a helluva time with the road . He 'd been over there a time or two himself to clear the dammed culverts . Once he 'd spent part of a morning taking potshots at the animals as they swam across their new pond , but he had n't hit anything . Beaver learned fast . He 'd told Sandhurst he 'd trap them out if he wanted . Sandhurst , it looked like , had decided to do it right . Indians had unrestricted rights to trap beaver . The boy was definitely Indian . <p> " You know what you 're doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm doing . " The boy shrugged his wrists up into the sleeves of his plaid coat . " My uncle said to come out here and look it over . He also said to come to you , let you know . His legs are bad today . " <p> " You walk in from the gate ? " <p> The boy nodded . <p> " Sandhurst plan to send you a key ? " <p> A shrug again like that did n't really matter . The boy lifted one foot , then the other , restless . The boots he wore were too large for him and cracked along the soles . They 'd be wet and awkward in the bogs . <p> " Who 's your uncle ? He know me from somewhere ? " <p> The boy stepped back like he 'd been cut loose by the question . <p> " He did n't say to talk about it : ' A straight look , black-eyed . " Just said to tell you I had the job . If you knew that , he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made his chest burn in the old way to watch the boy walk off like he did , easy , preoccupied . He 'd be a better man , he thought , if he did n't want to bust everybody like they were on his crew . Yet it was the truth that he sometimes lost his taste for people for weeks at a time . It always came back to him , a doglike understanding of companionship . But as warm and viscous as the feeling was on its return , this desire to tolerate others , to congregate with them , it remained fickle within him . It made him a disappointment , too-he knew that-but he had n't decided to live any other way . <p> The boy 's face came back to him when the day was done . He had n't left by the road , choosing to hack through the undergrowth instead , or to follow the rocky hip of the lake . That was how he imagined it , anyway-the boy 's evasion . But as he fried his potatoes and onions in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes came back to him . The boy reminded him a little of Henderson , that was the only connection he could make . Henderson was an Indian , too , from somewhere up in New York state , and he 'd been a cook on the Pontiac for a while . Reasonable cook , reasonable man . Not much remarkable about him , though he never ran short of coffee , ever , which was a good trait in a galley man . Most of his people walked steel in Pittsburgh or New York City , that 's what he said , but he 'd signed onto a freighter out of Buffalo after his stint in the Army and never looked back . Henderson told some good stories , as most cooks did-he remembered that . The man kept his hair braided , he told stories while he worked both messes , officers ' and crew 's , he stayed out of people 's business . It was funny he even recalled Henderson ; he 'd worked with hundreds of men on a long line of ships . But this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't been , running coal up the dark spine of Lake Erie , her every inch , he remembered , stinking of black dust and hurry . Henderson had never been able to cook a meal that did n't taste of it . <p> Later , when he was on his bunk with the radio turned low , a hockey game from endless Canada , he believed Henderson had n't been on the Pontiac at all . It had been the bad luck McCurdy . Memories lagged and heeled , and he understood he 'd hoped to fool himself . Yet even as he closed his eyes , he found he could clarify little more than the smell of burnt anthracite and onion . Henderson would have laughed to hear it . No ship 's cook he knew had ever been so bad he ruined onions . <p> He turned off the radio and lay square on the bunk . It seemed as though he ought to prepare himself for something that was as yet out of sight , beyond guessing . The thing he called his storm sense was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his skull . A low pressure system , maybe . Illness . Maybe ghosts . He 'd have to bide his time before he knew . <p> The snow came . Not enough to plow but enough to blanket the ground , quilt its mineral smells , leave him to feel like his season had begun . Most of the years he 'd sailed on the lakes , they 'd made it into December , the ice of Superior would hold off that long , so he was n't home to see the tatted crystals begin to fringe the bay or to taste the air 's last flavor of earth . He returned to a world already insulated and hard . There were the years he 'd bunked in Toledo , of course . Not so cold there , or easy . That was when he 'd been married , had a house , aimed to study his way off deck and onto the bridge , a foolishness he 'd undertaken for Mary and her sad , pleading face , though it had been a good thing in the end . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seamen worked as many voyages as they could hustle . Mary believed she wanted him home in that gum-green cottage above the scudding Maumee . So he studied when he could and parlayed his long years aboard into favors . Made himself into a third mate from nothing in the days when such a thing could still be done . Then he lost Mary . <p> He gathered half a sack of Idas from the cold porch and set off down the track , his head soon clear in the still , dry air . He took the apples up on a knoll he knew , one that had the black trickle of a spring at its base . The deer would find the shriveled fruit by sundown . He fed them most of the winter if he could-carrots , apples , acorns-not so he could hunt them , but so he could know they were there and that they would stay there , in his woods , because of him . He had n't taken a buck on his own property in several years . Foolishness , no doubt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family had owned this land above the bay for more than a hundred years . They 'd logged it , fished it , trapped it , hunted it , tried to sell it to rich people from downstate who did n't stick . Now they held it because it was easy to hold and righteous to claim . He stayed there because his brother and sister did n't care if he did otherwise , and because it was good for him to be planted , safer . It made him pay attention to himself-this place that expected little of him , which needed even less than he gave . The lakes had not been like that . <p> He 'd nearly ruined the memory because he 'd dragged it out so much , the one about how he got his start on water . He 'd been young and crazy and skittish , enraged by his father in all the usual ways . So he hitched rides on mail boats and farm trucks , made his way to Leeland , where there was damn near nothing to do , and lied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L. They wanted him on the black gang shoveling coal , but when he convinced them he halfway knew how to navigate and that he 'd skidded his share of logs in his life , they put him on the deck crew instead . It was merciless work , yet he loved it in ways it took him years to understand . Weather and exasperation , water and breakdown-he went at it all . <p> The captain was an arrogant drunk who used his instruments and charts when he felt like it . The mate , soon satisfied that he could n't buffalo the new boy , gave him half of his own job to do , and he lasted at it as long as the Alma L. did . The captain ran her across a bar near the Manitous in a spunky summer storm ; the mean pounding they took there snapped the chain to her rudder . Another vessel answered the captain 's obscene distress call and was able to put a line across Alma 's bow , but it was clear they 'd need to jettison cargo if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went into a blind rage when he heard that , calling for barges to take on his pulpwood , then for a breeches buoy rescue , though they were too far from shore for that and no one but the captain himself was old enough to have ever seen such a thing . He helped the mate cut loose a level of logs , but the captain ordered them to stop and struck them both across the face with a leather lanyard . It was the first act of shipboard madness he 'd seen . <p> Since they were n't allowed to rebalance her load , the Alma L. listed starboard and eventually heeled over in the waves . He later heard that she was salvaged and that she and her captain made hell and money in those waters for many years after . He , however , disappeared as quietly as he 'd come , heading south until he found deck passage across Lake Michigan to Wisconsin . He 'd been told that the place he needed to be was Duluth . Freighters reigned both the Iron Range and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within him , even at sixteen , that some men were meant to labor their way toward extremes of their own choosing . <p> He walked until he could n't think about that version of himself anymore , then he turned back . He skirted the thicket of the cedar bog , passed close to a bear 's den he knew about , eyed the empty trees . On his way to the cabin , he saw a speckled scatter of feathers near the splintered stump of a pine and realized that there was a thing he would miss until spring , the shy occupation of the loons on the bay , the full sound of their inhuman laughter . <p> Some days later the boy left him a note on the ground near his door . Set 3 traps , it said . Uncle still sick . The note was written in pencil on a large , silvery square of birch bark . Its letters were careful and upright . The boy had even signed his name . Frank Andrews . When he walked out to the track , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy 's misfit boots as he labored under the weight of his traps . A stagger coming and going , and that was all . <p> That night he awoke in his chair near the stove only to realize that his deck crew had not run short of paint and primer , that his boiling anxiety about a young wheelman was phantom vapor and heat . He thought about taking a drink . He thought about going beyond solitude toward something dark and squatting entirely . He believed he 'd been talking in his sleep , though to whom he could n't say . <p> His sister , Frieda , liked him to come for Sunday dinner , so he went when he felt like it or guessed she could use a little money or help around the house . Cecil , her husband , was a long-haul trucker who did what he could when he had the time . Frieda had been talking for years now about how good things would be when Cecil finally got a job at the prison . But prison jobs were hard to come by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . <p> Frieda never said much about the money he slipped her when he visited . He told her to consider it rent , since he was living on property that belonged to all three of them . She kept the books for a gift shop in town and made a few things to sell there herself-wood-burnt plaques and Snow Island table runners-but she mostly stayed home with the boys . She 'd take the money from him , her big brother , and thank him for something else , firewood or a door he 'd rehung . They both knew if they stooped to talking about money , they 'd end up discussing the years he 'd traded most of his for liquor . <p> This Sunday they had sauerbraten that Frieda had marinated , and mashed potatoes , and a salad thrown together by the boys . He was in the kitchen smoking the one cigarette his sister allowed ; his nephews were watching football on the TV in the den . Somehow it came about that he told Frieda of the boy 's visit to the beaver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last few weeks , unless he counted finding a gut-shot doe near the north edge of the bog a piece of news , and Frieda did n't like to hear about things like that . Ravens had led him to the doe , the heavy way they croaked and gathered in the treetops attracting his attention more than usual , and he 'd cut the doe 's throat with his knife , though she was nearly dead , anyway . Frieda would n't want to hear about the ravens , either , or the raucous bald eagles , or the chipmunk which desperately wanted to hibernate on his porch . His sister liked to hear about the human leftovers , snapped saw blades or rusted drag chains , implements that proved the Hansens had broken their backs and spilled their sweat out there in the woods like any other family with an honest history . She also liked him to talk about how things were along the western shallows of the bay where they 'd built teepees of birch saplings and bark when they were children , the three of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that place , she said , how the yellow sun fell off behind the spiked fence of the pines , the way grilling fish smelled , and she would never forget it . She wished Cecil would take the boys there , just pitch a tent and forget about the motorboat for one damn day . But she never suggested he take his nephews instead , as though it would not be the right favor to ask , as though his choice to live the way he did now , just like his choice to sign onto a steamer thirty-some years before , was the wrong combination of impulsiveness and love . <p> " You say his name is Andrews ? " Frieda scraped hard at a crusted pot . " Paula Andrews 's got a son still in school , and I know you know who Paula is . " <p> Frieda did n't bother to turn away from the sink after she spoke , but he understood he was about to be punished . " Chad , " she shouted , " get your butt in here . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scuffle before his oldest nephew appeared in the doorway with his forearms folded across his black T-shirt . He felt Chad look at him neutrally , the one houseguest he did n't have to behave for . They 'd had a short conversation at dinner about his Venezuelan tattoo and how much it had hurt , and they 'd talked about the Lake State hockey team . It had been enough for both of them . <p> " Frank Andrews go to school with you ? " <p> " Not no more . Dropped out . " Chad lifted his arms above his head and mimed a jump shot . " Chip kid . You know how it is . " <p> " I know it 's tough for everybody . " Frieda dried her palms on her skirt , looked at him , then away . " Take the garbage out , will you , then go on back and behave . Leave your brother alone . " <p> Chad headed toward where his boots were sprawled on a rug by the door . " His mom 's the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , " Frieda snapped . " I better not find out you 've been over there : ' <p> Chad clomped out the door without his coat , and his sister turned on him . " Get what you came for , Johnny ? I could have hooked you up with Paula without feeding you a good dinner . " <p> He spun his glazed coffee mug between his hands . There were lots of Andrewses between here and the Soo . He had n't really thought about the boy belonging to Paula . " I have n't been in there in a long time , " he said . " Not since before I retired . " <p> Frieda sat opposite him at the table . Her fair skin was smooth and pretty , flushed with the anger she 'd stirred up , but still pretty . He was more than ten years older than she was , and there 'd been times he 'd taken care of her as well as any parent could . " I guess I 'd be the first to hear otherwise , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd like to keep Chad out of there . He takes after Cecil 's side , too slow to stay out of trouble . Not like his uncle . " <p> He listened to her voice , careful and parched with forgiveness . Cecil ought to be around more , he thought , or somebody should . " Paula Andrews just poured the drinks I ordered , " he said . " And it 's all over , anyhow . I do n't have time to drink . " <p> Frieda laughed then , raising her chin and flexing her shoulders just as their father had when things were right with him . " You got time to do nothing but drink , so you give it up like a stubborn bastard . John Hansen , always cutting his own trail . " <p> He stood , the trill of her chuckle running through him . Frieda closed things up between them ; she always had . She flattened her hand as he slipped a fifty-dollar bill from his pocket . " Take the leftovers with you , do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the wood . Chad and C.J. stacked it like you taught them . It 's worked out good . " <p> He drove like he was in a hurry until he reached the blinking yellow light across from the grocery , where he turned toward the water . He drifted past the house of a childhood friend who was on disability from his job with the road commission . Two doors down was the brown , asbestos-shingled bungalow his own family had lived in during a good stretch . The lake was in front of him , broken up by the gaunt reach of a few docks and the frosted cluster of Les Cheneaux Islands . The water here looked black , but common , polished into a series of pathways that led from shelter to shelter . <p> He parked , but it was n't until he was out of the truck , his fingers working at the large horn buttons of his jacket , that he realized he was just up the block from The Chinook . He 'd been thinking about Otto and how he was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fidgeting had driven everything else from his head . Everything except muscle memory . He walked across the damp , deserted street and looked in the storefront window of the bar . Closed until four . Chairs upended on the tables like spindly carcasses . Pool table in the same naked place . There were plastic garlands strung with Christmas lights nailed inside the window frame , though the lights were n't plugged in , and he could see a pall of fine dust on the sprigs of false holly and cedar . There was a tiny creche nestled in cotton wadding on the varnished windowsill as well . Touches of Paula . Sweet . Well-meaning . Incomplete . He reopened the top button of his coat and began to search for his gloves . He 'd lived a piece of his life in The Chinook , fighting , paring down love , filling his core with the false heat of bourbon . Then he 'd moved on . The building felt no different in his mind now than the small dog-brown bungalow hunkered just out of sight on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He knew Otto would be working , even with the marina shut until spring , because that 's what Otto did . His brother had repainted the building that fall , and he 'd put in double-paned windows and new barn-red awnings . But he had n't changed the name of their father 's business . It was the same . Hansen and Sons . Boat Builders . Docks . Storage . <p> He knocked on the bolted front door , though he had a key to the lock on his own key ring . Otto had never been one for surprises . He waited , then heard a motor fire up just as he was setting his face to meet his brother 's . The engine sounded muted and sluggish in the cold . He stepped around the corner of the shop , across the old launch ramp that was now boarded up , and toward the quay . His brother was casting off in the Chris-Craft , his face a putty-colored mask above his coveralls and the thick , speckled scarf done up for him by his wife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glazed with ice , and the inlet was curdled with slush . Boxes and bags crowded the floor of the boat behind where Otto stood at the wheel , his movements stiff but sure as he throttled into the channel . He was running groceries to widows and shut-ins out among the islands , stern and charitable with his yellow Labrador braced against his legs , her nose raised in the slapping air . That was his younger brother , as able and Lutheran as they came . He watched Otto take the chill breath of the lake across his face , watched him handle himself as any good wheelman might as his wake spooled and crimped the dark water . Something about the sight made his neck feel bowstrung , but he conquered it . Then he worked his way back to his still warm truck and the narrow , patchy roads to the bay . <p> The boy came when the girl got hurt , and it later seemed to him that the boy , Frank Andrews , had guessed that they 'd be shut up in a room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . He was patching the wall behind his wood stove with metal cut from a wrecked panel truck because it 's what he had for the job . There 'd been a wet five-inch snow the night before ; he did n't feel like plowing his way toward town . Besides , he liked an ugly repair that called on him to be resourceful . <p> The cabin door was open a crack for fresh air , but the boy knocked on the jamb , anyway . The noise of the knock pivoted him against the stove , crouching . Then he saw it was the boy from the brownish slash of face , the drained color of his hat . " Yeah , " he said , standing with the hammer still in his hand . <p> " It 's Frank Andrews . " The boy laid out each syllable like it was stolen . " Got my beaver , but had a accident with a trap and wondered if you had a bandage . Just till I can get to my car . " <p> He went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shock could make a bad thing seem not so bad at first . A man could break an arm in one of those traps . The low , marbled sky was spitting snow which had begun to dust the boy 's sturdy shoulders with flakes . He took in the boy 's eyes first , which were black and even and undeluded by pain , then he saw the sleek carcass of a beaver cast into a pocket drift near a corner of the shack . It was bloodless as it ought to be since the traps were made to drown a beaver and never tear its pelt . It took him a moment to register the girl standing half-shielded by the boy . She was the one who 'd been hurt . One of her hands was cupped beneath the other like a bowl , collecting the run of blood . <p> " Get in here , " he said , " get on in , " and he did n't take time to say what he wanted to say about the cramped way he lived . The blood he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of it . There 'd be more in the heat of the cabin , but if she had n't nicked an artery he supposed he could handle it . Otherwise , it would be compresses and blankets and a damn crazy dozer ride out to the road . Neither kid did anything more than cross the threshold , though the boy reached for the girl 's elbow , as if to offer her rivuleted skin as evidence of some sort of sincerity . " I got a first-aid kit , " he said before either of them could start with an explanation . " Sit her in my chair and lay that hand where I can see it . " <p> Coat and cap off , hands washed , kit opened on the table , which was scoured smooth and clean because he kept it that way . He 'd never served as purser onboard , but he 'd cleaned up his share of sailors after fights or mishaps with winches and snapped lines . He 'd doctored himself plenty , too . He placed a towel under the girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown , contracted some with pain and worry , though her cold-flushed mouth flitted with a smile that was part embarrassment , part apology . Indian , too , he decided , though not as full-blooded as the boy . Her hair was pulled off her face and hung down her back in a smooth , water-beaded hank . It was easy for him to see that she was pretty . Of course any son of Paula 's would be used to that , fine looks in a woman , though whether he 'd come to expect it , to search for it , was maybe another matter . He laid his own toughened fingertips at the base of her hand , felt it quiver , yet coaxed her without words to open her fingers . She shivered all over then , and he remembered what little he 'd seen of her when she 'd been standing on his doorstep . She was wet to the waist , soaking wet , like anybody might be who went after beaver dressed in jeans and cheap stay-in-town boots . He nodded to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table . " Build up the fire , will you ? Or the hypothermia will get to her before I do . " <p> The cut was ragged and ran from the crease of her ring finger across her palm to the fleshy base of her thumb , which accounted for the good amount of blood . Her thawing hands ached and stung ; he could see that , too . And before he thought about it , he was massaging them some with his own , carefully , his skin feeling husklike to him against the raw damp of hers . She was smallboned , trembling . He daubed at her palm with a corner of the towel , then looked into her eyes , which gave him nothing . Without wiping his own fingers clean , he began to irrigate the wound . <p> " I can fix this good enough to get you to the clinic . You going up to the Soo ? " <p> Neither of them answered him at first , though the girl dropped her head so he could see its delicate oval crown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Ignace , " the boy said from where he was squatting by the stove . " She 's from there . " <p> " They got a Indian clinic there , somewhere she can get stitches ? " <p> " It 'll get taken care of . " The boy 's voice was harder than it needed to be , and he wondered if they 'd both been scared out there , truly afraid they were up against it , and that was what was holding them in so tight . Then again , maybe he 'd made some kind of mistake . Maybe the girl was n't Indian at all . <p> " Good , " he said . " You take care of it . Because I can sew it up here and now if you 're planning on getting stupid on me , or lazy " <p> The girl flinched so hard her knuckles knocked against the tabletop . The boy , Frank , stood halfway and took on a look that read mad-as-hell , which made him feel solid to see because he knew how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this unprepared for ministering , had brought a floating feeling to his stomach and beneath his words that he did not care for . <p> " Do n't do no more . " The boy moved up against the table again . " She 's all right . Shelley , you all right ? " <p> She nodded and began to push away from the heavy oak table , her hand stained orange with disinfectant but unbandaged , gaping . She seemed caught in the swift stream of the boy 's assurance . Her legs failed her , though , faster than even he 'd foreseen , because they 'd been half-assed , all of them , and had n't stripped her of her wet boots and clothes . She sank toward the chair , faltered , fell against the boy . He caught her under the arms and lifted her as though he 'd cradled her before , then carried her to the bunk without asking . That was fine , though , he thought . It was the right thing to do . <p> " We need to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware that his voice had gone solemn and whispery , though the girl was very much awake . " I 've got some clothes . See if she 'll undress . " He went to the place he kept his chest and flipped open the smooth brass latches while they spoke in low voices behind him . Everything in the chest was neatly folded and held the warm , powdery scent of cedar . It was easy to find what he needed . <p> " She wants to dress herself , " the boy said , and the girl , who was sitting upright now on his scarred bunk , swung her head in blank agreement . " You . . . we . . . , " the boy half-coughed , " we make her nervous . Could we leave for a minute , let her take care of it ? " <p> " Yes , " he said , and that was all . He scooped up his cap and coat from the floor where they 'd fallen and headed out the door . He 'd forgotten to expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door behind them , and the clean , diffuse light the snow carried with it made it seem as though they 'd stepped into a white , high-ceilinged room , one just large enough to handle their talk and commotion . He stepped over to the plump carcass of the beaver , knelt next to it . Its dead eyes and yellowed teeth were invisible , buried , yet he thought he could smell the oily , musky taint of panic . <p> " You planning to haul it out yourself ? " The beaver was big , sixty pounds easy . <p> " She 's strong , " the boy said , tilting his head toward the cabin . " That 's why I brung her along . " <p> He laughed until the boy showed his well-spaced teeth , and then it was in him , fast and mean , to give his laugh an ugly twist . A girl like that should n't be out here , though he thought he understood why she 'd come . The boy was rocking on his feet again , rippling with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . Women would follow the stream of that energy as long as the boy had it , he thought . Follow it and try to drink it down . Before he knew it he 'd reached into his pocket for two cigarettes and a lighter . It amazed him , the way two people could make headway without words . He thought briefly of the girl drying her small , cold-clenched body with his bath towel , the live tinge that would come to her skin , the darkening smears of her blood . Then something about the way the boy handled his cigarette , his whole body sheltering the lighter 's blue-whipped flame , brought a question to mind . " You play some basketball ? " He tapped his own smoke on a thumbnail . " I think my nephew talked about that . " <p> The boy narrowed his eyes as if he were measuring something . He raised one hand , cocked it at the wrist , then flipped it forward . He could see that was all the answer he would get . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even though his body remembered the moves , would forever remember them , he 'd stopped tunneling into that game with his mind . <p> " We can stand out here and freeze , then , just standing here . Or we can load that beaver in my truck . " He bent over and scythed the snow off the glossy pelt with the edge of his hand . " I 'll take you out to your car . " <p> The boy squinted at him through a scrim of smoke , then shrugged the way he did . <p> " Check on her first , maybe , " he said . " Make sure she 's using the blankets . " <p> The boy grabbed at his frosted hat and stuck his head back inside the cabin . He could see that the boy 's hair had been cut since he 'd last seen him . It fell in a smooth , blunt line along the flat muscle of his jaw and the coppery nape of his neck . <p> " She 's all right , " the boy said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dressing . " <p> They squatted as a pair and shared the beaver 's weight as they lifted . He glanced up the track and made a guess that the Ford would get to the road all right ; it would be a lot easier if they could travel in a heated cab . When the beaver was laid out in the truck bed , he found his fingers spidering through his pockets for more cigarettes . The boy seemed impressed that he had two trucks in the shed , plus the dozer and a good canoe . He wanted to know about the machines , if they all drove well . " Used to know your mother , " he said to the boy instead , and right away the words hung from him like brittle ice from a branch . He felt foolish . The boy probably knew all he wanted to know about old Hermit Hansen . He had no business trying to make himself out to be another kind of man . <p> " Everybody knows my ma . " The boy ran a hand along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the roomy bed . " Everybody from around here , anyway . Long time she 's worked at The Chinook . " <p> " I shot pool in there some , when I was n't shipped out . " <p> " Thought you hardly ever left this place . " The boy blew some air into his hands , kept his eyes on the truck . " Guard it like a damn Doberman or something . " <p> Hearing that strangled the bland words he 'd aligned in his throat , and he stepped out of the shed into a dervish of snow that whirled off the roof . He tried to lock his mind onto the idea of the half-dressed girl , how she needed to be wreathed in warmth , gotten home . <p> " Hey , you want to tell me about my ma , go ahead . " There was swagger in the boy 's words now . " I 've heard it before . One million times . So do n't think you know a story that 'll get to me . You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the boy , headed back to where he stood in the shelter of the shed . But he could n't get his head to go all silky like it needed to be before he went into a fight . He could n't even bring Paula 's smooth , silent , commiserating face into focus , her sympathetic neck . He stopped , letting the wind split at his back . <p> " I guess now you 're gon na tell me Ma 's the reason you keep women 's clothes way out here . " The boy had his arms away from his sides , hands flexing . " Do it , then . Come at me with your weird-old-man shit . Cause no woman would ever come here for you . You ca n't tell me that . " <p> It had been a long while since he 'd been where the anger took him , riding roughshod through nerve and vein , howling within him louder than the words in his bitten throat could howl . Yet it came easily enough . He did n't bother to wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , clucking and fluttering in outrage . He went straight to the cabin , burst inside with his vision blanched by fury and the ungiving glare of snow . The girl was slumped on his bunk , drowsy maybe , wilted by comfort . He grabbed her where her shoulder met her collarbone , bent on flinging her to her feet , which he did . She gasped , and he felt her warm , shocked , caressing breath but did n't hear it . Did n't hear the boy tear into the cabin , either , though he knew when he was behind him , exactly there , and was able to meet him with a solid punch to the gut when it was time . He flung the girl 's shortwaisted coat after her and her false-furred boots and her wet , crumpled clothes . He flung them both out , into the world where they could keep their messes to themselves . The girl began to cry , but he was deaf to that also . He did see the boy 's face , though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of brows , the jagged , uncentered glint in the eyes . It meant the boy had been cornered for the first time . That he 'd just about found a new edge to plunge over . <p> He barely heard the bleating curses and the crude battering of his truck as they tore at the tailgate and took their beaver back . They would have stolen the truck if they could have , maybe even wrecked it . It 's what he would have done . He watched them hump up the track with the beaver bowing the boy 's infuriated young body , the girl stumbling along behind . He noticed that the girl had left her soaked garments strewn between the cabin and the shed , and he thought he could either burn them or fold them into his sea chest-that it would n't matter which he did . He saw , too , that she 'd wrapped her hand with the gauze he 'd laid out for her . There was the blankness of a bandage on her , just as there was the resin color of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turtleneck on her slender torso and arms , the musky linger of her sweat . What he did n't know and could n't give a good history to were those vagabond clothes , what she 'd taken from him . He did not recall who they 'd once belonged to or whether he 'd known her name at all . <p> The nights became as long as they ever get , and as stark , and the wave-etched ice shelved itself around the bay and out into the lake until the shipping channels were closed . Snow came in sheets and squalls and perfect geometric drifts . On clear days he hauled wood in the restless company of crows , skidding pallets of poplar and deadfall oak in from the far-off places he 'd stacked them . On days when the sky seemed no higher than the treeline and the smoke from his chimney fumed at his door , he stayed in , flipped cards , listened to the insistent radio . He spent some complicated hours with a T square drawing up plans for a sauna , but he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open a carton of cigarettes and thought about the boy . He had n't been back for his traps . It was no way to run a line , but laziness of that sort was up to the boy and his uncle , if there really was an uncle . He considered how he 'd once connected the boy with Henderson and what a mistake that had been . Henderson had a sense of humor and a bolt-tight sense of himself as a man . Henderson had never thrown anything in another man 's face , which was where the boy 's weakness was , in his impetuous , assuming pride . Good sailors withheld almost all there was to withhold aboard ship-it was how any crew avoided murder-and if a sailor was smart , he behaved much the same way when he had to be on land . Surviving . Two legs to stand on . <p> Henderson on the McCurdy . They 'd been aboard together , hauling a capacity load of taconite out of Duluth , running to make St. Marys River before she froze . On his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some of the vessels aheadespecially the empty ones-heaved to in the lee of Keweenaw Point or short of the river , where thick fog was said to be mothering chunk ice and sleet . The John C. McCurdy steamed on . He had little trouble driving her into the black , foaming swells and keeping her trim . At next watch , though , things were different . <p> The old man was on the bridge by then , sleepless , thin-lipped . The wind screeched through the gangways , and the water they took across the bow began to rivet itself into a crystal armor of ice . Radio reports put them on the near side of a full-blown gale . The captain was an able man , overly cautious but never stupid . He ordered a change of course designed to run with wind and current alike . But McCurdy began to wallow under the extra weight of the ice . Two hours later the propeller gave way , unable to take the strain of being pitched into open air , then slammed into the mad roil of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrench and give , and they hated the loss of momentum , the wheezing surge that had been the one force under their control . The captain radioed the Coast Guard and prepared for a merciless wait . <p> A twin-screw freighter from Canada offered to backtrack and give McCurdy a line to keep her off the shoals . But the captain told the freighter to tend to her own needs ; he was nearly far enough east to be safe . And this was how Third Mate Hansen left things when he climbed from the bridge . Square-shouldered men not thinking ahead . Stoic . <p> He came into the officers ' mess dripping and swearing . The air in the galley was stale with breath and sweat and the soggy smell of food no one wanted . He coughed into his hands , tasting the layered man-stink while he exhaled the arctic swipe of the storm . He noticed there was a passenger in the galley , a smallish withered man who was trying to read a magazine . It bothered him that the man was not in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crew that had trouble on its hands , but he said nothing . <p> " Sandwich , " he called to Henderson , and he shed his rain gear behind the chair that was his . Sloppy , irregular , but he did it , anyway . The ship fell off into a trough ; each man braced himself for dive and recovery . Devil 's pride , he told himself , all of them pretending that this cork-tossing was normal . <p> " I got some fish and some ham , " Henderson said , his dark arms crossbarred in the doorway . " Your choice , sir . " <p> That made them both laugh . " Make me four hams to run topside with some coffee . I ca n't stay here . " <p> " Sure you can . No man is that everlasting important . " The words came from the passenger , sudden and taunting . He glanced at Henderson for confirmation of the man 's impertinence , but Henderson had turned to his work , bowed and uninvolved , so he angled his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Maybe I do n't care if I 'm important . It 's my job . " <p> " No , it 's not , Mate Hansen . You 've pulled your watch . You were off at twelve bells . " <p> " This is a bad time , sir . " <p> " This , " the man said delightedly , " is what a freshwater sailor would call a bad time . " <p> The old fellow , he decided , was crazy with worry , or simply crazy . He yanked his slicker from the floor while the McCurdy balanced atop yet another wind-shorn crest . He moved into the galley as she paused , looking for a place to steady himself because he did n't like the way she felt , bovine , resigned . The ship plunged hard , then submarined . He found himself pressed next to Henderson in the tight space below the ovens . The Indian showed clenched teeth . The passenger , it sounded like , was flung against a wall . Seconds later the bow pulled free of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd need worse luck to lose her-he knew that-but the captain would want him to ready the boats just the same . <p> Henderson went to help the passenger while he tucked his pockets full of sandwiches and a thermos . He listened as the passenger insisted he was unhurt . " I am fine , " he chided the cook . " You men have been through nothing if you ca n't chin up to this . " Henderson said something inaudible , and the passenger began to cackle , then cough . " I 've been washed ashore bare-arsed twice in my life . You ever sail Torpedo Alley off Cape Hatteras ? Ever hear of the bloody hell called Dunkirk ? " He paused long enough to hear the man 's hollow accent become more British than it had been before . The captain had passed along a name at one pointBurley ? Billingsley ? -a joyrider , the captain said , with plenty of money . He fastened his slicker and made his way to the corner , where Henderson had propped the man upright . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " He leaned into the yellowish , translucent face that up close seemed shrunken by illness . He had n't seen that before , or the blood dribbling from a split lip , and he felt pity mix with frustration in his gut , a blend he did n't like . " If that 's what you 're after , I 'll make it my business to see you do n't get it . Not on this ship : ' <p> " You do n't give the orders . " The man bared his pinkened teeth for a laugh . <p> He grabbed the man 's throat , sank his fingers into slack , wattled flesh , and shoved until the galley wall banged , then banged again . " I give the orders needed , you bastard . Go back where you came from and do it while you can . " <p> He stood and wiped the spit from his lips . The McCurdy chose that moment to slither and spasm beneath them . He could sense the massive torque along her keel . <p> " There it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet wheezed . " You feel it . You 'll be my man before all 's well and done . " <p> He struck the man outright . With the flat of his hand at first , then his rapid fist . The old fellow closed his eyes , and his head went loose on his neck , as though he 'd been beaten before and knew how to take it . Three punches , maybe four . He stopped when the cartilage of the thin , arrogant nose gave way beneath his knuckles . <p> It was Henderson who surprised him . The cook looked like he planned to drive his own fist into the man 's sunken gut . Yet he somehow fell away from the scarecrow collapse of the passenger , every glint of irritation and resolve drained from his eyes . His grim mouth moved in silence . He watched Henderson hard until the cook gasped as if he 'd just discovered air . It was the ship , he thought . The damned strangling ship . Or the garrote of the storm . Henderson had caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and speechless , and he had not . <p> It was n't long before the cook came back into himself , ran his blade-nicked hands across his white apron , and offered to haul the passenger to his quarters , clean him up . Henderson 's voice was low and easy , as always . Neither of them mentioned what had just yawed between them . If they spoke of it , they 'd do so after the McCurdy had docked and unloaded and the time for stories had come . He left the galley in silence , turning his thoughts to his stubborn crew and what he would ask of them . The lifeboats would be frozen hard to their tackle , and the one on the bow might not be there at all . They 'd have to go out-on lines or not-and see . And he would go out among them . <p> Some days later he found himself back in Frieda 's kitchen , feeling browbeaten for reasons that were mucky in his own head . He had n't been in touch with his sister for almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his box at the post office , searching for his pension check and finding letters from charities and colored flyers for the Christmas craft fair . He 'd missed the holidays . He stopped at the hardware store and bought his nephews gifts . It would be okay , he thought , to give Frieda money as he usually did . Perfume , a sweater , a scarf-it would n't feel right to buy something like that for her . He planned for them to handle one another as they always had , without decoration . <p> It was the middle of the week , so Frieda put coffee on and allowed him his cigarette , but there was no food . The boys were still at school . The Christmas decorations , which his sister lavished on every surface of her small house , were gone , stored for another year . The brown paper bag that held the unwrapped gifts for his nephews mocked him from the kitchen countertop . A stupid idea . Weak . He smoked in silence , trusting he could hold fast longer than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something . He watched Frieda take things out of the refrigerator and the pantry . She stooped and bent , but even in a sweatshirt and purplish jeans , she did n't appear old to him . She was nimble , still concerned with the visitations of failure or success . He was the one who 'd aged . He 'd run from so many things , he 'd pretty much run his way to the end of his life . <p> " You talk to them ? " <p> " Marge and Otto ? Oh , sure . They were here for- " She shook her head in disbelief . " We all got together for the holidays . Just once , but it was nice . Marge brought the ham , and the girls got along all right with C.J. and Chad . Otto complained about the government , as usual , and the bank , too , if you can believe that . He 's on the G.D . board there . I thought Cecil would just bust . " <p> They laughed , both of them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good brother , so sure of his restraint . <p> " Sorry I missed the party . " <p> " No , you 're not . And I 'll tell you again what I told you last year . We 've got so we do n't miss you . Do n't even bring up your name . " Frieda was behind him , sweeping the floor . He could hear the hasty , scritching strokes of the broom . <p> " Makes it easier . " <p> " Yes , it does . " <p> He stood and drifted into the den , into the crabbed and narrow hallway that was so much like the hallways of his youth , drifted into the yellow-tiled bath looking for something to tinker with . When he asked Frieda where he might find replacement screws for the hinges of the clothes hamper , she handed him a shoe box of junk-buttons , paper clips , hardware-and told him to get on with it . He wanted to thank her for taking him up again , but he did n't . He thought about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unspoiled or new . He was sorting nails and scrap when his nephews charged into the house , faces stung red from the cold , their cheap , oversized parkas flapping . <p> They launched into competing stories about teachers and bus brawls before they saw him . C.J. , the young one , clammed up at once . Chad dropped his backpack on the table and took up as much space as he could between his uncle and his mom . <p> " Did you tell him yet ? " Chad pinned him with a squint , like he was studying long words on a sign . <p> " No . " Frieda gathered the coats , knocked the slushy boots into a corner . " Has n't come up . " <p> " Well , I 'm bringing it up . Everybody 's talking about it . " <p> " Just to be gross , " C.J. said , edging out of the room . He was a large-eyed kid , and shy . " You like to think about him underwater all winter , down there with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Frieda waved an arm as though she was goodhumored and tolerant , but he could see the creases around her mouth deepen and how she would n't look his way . " Out of here , and keep it down . Uncle John and me are talking . " <p> " Then talk to him , will you ? " Chad strode into the den . " It 's like he lives in the desert or something . " <p> He did a calm inventory in his head . The family was fine-he knew that . Something local , then . A thing spectacular to people who decided to share their tragedies . <p> " It 's just one of those sad messes kids get caught up in because it bothers them . Maybe it 'll bother you , too . It was the one you know , Paula 's boy . He was running hay out to Mackinac , for the horses there , and the ice broke in a freak way . He 's so far down , they ca n't even dive for him . Driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> He looked at her , reacquainted himself with the wrinkles around her eyes . <p> " Plain bad luck is what they say . A squall got them off-track and they say one of the snowmobilers-some relative-was drunk , but they did n't do anything stupid . People make that run all the time . " <p> " Been making it for years , " he said . <p> " Yeah , " she said , looking at him like she could n't quite bring his hairline into focus . " Horses have to eat just like the rest of us . Some guy in St. Ignace has the contract , and he let this kid , what 's his name , drive the Cat because he asked to . The paper said some nice things . " <p> " Same as dying in a car wreck , " he said . <p> " Maybe so . All the way to the bottom , though , that 's different . Feels different to me . " <p> She went on then-to a salting and pounding of meat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner . He did n't . He stood and rinsed his mug , emptied the green glass ashtray into the trash , found his hat and gloves on top of the refrigerator where he 'd left them . Only when he went to put on the gloves did he realize his left fist was clenched . When he opened it he saw two wood screws pressed deep into his callused skin , so deep they ought to hurt . <p> " I 'm sorry , " his sister said . Her arms were folded tight over her chest , but her face was elongated , soft . <p> " About what ? " <p> " You know what I mean . " And she moved after him to shut the door , sealing her house again from the cold . <p> When he pulled in across from The Chinook , he realized that his mouth was wet and drooling for a drink while his throat was wrung dry . Divided up , he told himself . Same old story . He went inside , nodded to the men playing eight ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He ordered a Coke , and the bartender , a redhaired guy he did n't know , brought it to him right away . He left a good tip and moved to an empty round table against the wall . A stuffed salmon bucked on the wall above him . The air smelled of fry grease and sleep . <p> He finally thought to slip his coat off so he would n't look like he was on the run . Chewed on the ice in his Coke and watched the pool players circle the table like boxers , high-shouldered and flat-faced . He did n't have to wait long . She brought him a second Coke in a highball glass and sat down across from him . <p> " Hello , John . " She 'd always said it the same . <p> " Hello , Paula . Thought I 'd come see the sights . " He took in her face , which was thinner ; he looked for gray in her hair or any bad sign of grief . What he could see right away were diamond-chip earrings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " New jukebox . We got that for big dancers like you . And the kitchen 's been redone . You want some food ? " <p> " No , " and he shook his head as her wide-set brown eyes smiled . He 'd been puke-sick in front of her in the old days , there was that humiliation . He 'd touched her some as well , as much as she 'd allowed from an earnest drunk , since she had three or four kids already . That had happened maybe half a dozen times in ten years of drinking , shipping out , moving on . What he 'd kept with him most was what hung before him now-her lovely , unassailing face . <p> " I heard about your boy . " <p> She sat back in her chair and brought a hand up along her neck and ear . Her nails were still short-bitten . " I knew you were here because of that . You remembered , did n't you ? That time with the puppy . It 's good for me to think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little , even while she was trying not to , and the tears ran alongside her small , blunt nose . " I did n't see much of Frankie lately . He was living with his father 's people . Wanted to do for himself . " <p> He looked down , saw that his distant fingers were shredding a napkin . <p> " He loved when you sent me home with that crazy pup . Thought it was pure German shepherd and told everybody that , bragging . He was gon na train that dog , too , but it got killed on the road . " <p> All those kids , tangled shapes of her kids , tangle of what she said about them , and him never bothering to sort them out by name or size or worry . No one in The Chinook had . And one of them was Frank , into his life then out of it like an ass-whipped bad dream . He sat there knowing he 'd never given any kid a dog . <p> " He should n't have been on no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stupid . " <p> Paula tensed , looked at the wall next to them , then back . <p> " He was stupid about laying his traps , too . I could have told him if he listened one damn- " He choked up on his loud words as he realized the redhead bartender was watching him , and Paula was watching , too , but not in the right way . <p> " You come in here for whiskey , I wo n't sell you whiskey . " She wept openly , with the light of temper rising in her eyes . " Do n't talk down my boy , neither . It was an accident . Nobody meant no harm : ' <p> " I knew him . " He felt terribly hot under his clothes , like he needed to tear them open . " We got along , and then we did n't , and I tried- " <p> " Say you 're sorry , John . Then move on like we both got to . I 'm marrying Pete Norlund . " She sniffled and drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was with Pete . And now I do n't got that battle to fight . " <p> He took hold of his riptide mind , grappled and thought about Norlund , a barrel of a Swede older than himself , made rich off timber and real estate . There 'd been a stout wife around , last he 'd heard , but something had clearly been done about her . <p> " Maybe it 'll go good , Paula . You deserve it if anybody does . " <p> " Still know how to make sweet , do you ? I did n't never forget you or the things you did " She stood and covered one of his hands with hers while she reached for his empty glasses . A brush light and warm , but he could feel it go deep just before it left him . Saw her ring , too , set with hard , permanent diamonds . Norlund had a big glassy house on the lakefront . He would work to imagine her in there . <p> " Sorry about your boy . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty of tears and walked from him . A black , sleeveless blouse that was more modest than it needed to be . Good boots , tight jeans . Her long , thick hair fanning out from a silver conch clip that he immediately recognized , so like the ones he 'd almost brought to her after his trips away , the ones he 'd fingered and never bought in those smiling , jostling marketplaces far from home . <p> He took note of the ragged cuticles of snow left by the plows . Of the snapped-off tree branches . Of the convoyed clouds to the south . There was a way to carry on that every sailor learned after his first few watches-a way to remain alert but separate , never mesmerized or confused by the shape-shifting of fool water or the sky . Peering ahead , looking for decisions to make-that was the way a man remained clear . <p> He parked on the track , leaving room to swing the canoe out of the shed . He looked her over carefully first , eyeing the seams , checking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square of cloth from a shirt and some ambroid glue . She rested cleanly on her braces , a beamy wood-canvas shell . He 'd bought her from an old steam-tender who 'd foulhooked the end of his luck , gave the man a sluggish Grumman and a hundred dollars in exchange . The steam-tender said she came from Minnesota and was made the old-time trapper way , to last forever . Whatever the truth , she handled well in light water and was easy enough for one man to portage . He slid her off the braces , flipped her , then worked her up on end until he could yoke up between the varnished , seatworn thwarts . The snow was crusty and deep . It would be a long , panting carry . <p> By the time he could see the wide silver scuff of the bay , he 'd begun to sweat through his second shirt . <p> He took the canoe to the place he always took her , next to a great smooth log that had washed ashore in a spring storm not long after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer he chained the canoe along the far side of the log , but he did not chain her now . He merely nestled her into her accustomed place , protected as much from wind and weather as she could be . He was months early . Porcupines or others might do her some mischief , though it was not a possibility that bore thinking about . He 'd make up a special buoy before long , get together a good anchor and plenty of strong line . What he needed to consider now was when he would next be out on the water , stroking through the rocky blue shallows of the bay into the lake . <p> He made his way downshore to a natural cairn of porous , fossil-etched stones , swept them clean of snow , leaned against them . Mackinac Island was a tired mirage beneath the translucent clouds , a smudge of dirtied crystal . Winter had leveled it , as it leveled them all . The boy he 'd known had done nothing but take on a few jobs , try on his shifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more than anything had ever hurt him . He knew he would n't set foot in The Chinook again , not even to recast his words to her , the ones he 'd meant to say better . If he took up liquor , he 'd go to the next town to drink it , or drink it in the hidyhole of his shack like he was expected to . <p> The sun drifted west until the snow on the lake was shadowed in lavender and blue , and the trees drew themselves into a phalanx of darkness at his back . He had always cared for this , the way the lake sealed itself off , flat and silent and hidden . There was nothing practical to be done about the boy . He could walk the ponds and try to locate the beaver traps , though the uncle would surely come after them before long-maybe he 'd come with the girl-and he had no business pretending he was a help to anyone . He was not . <p> His sweat cooled but did not dry , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hush of an unhindered night brought Henderson back into his mind . Strong , private Henderson , who should have been a cook on the lollygagging , sweet-tempered Pontiac with its simple runs to Buffalo , but who kept manning the slipshod McCurdy in his mind . It had been Henderson who 'd done the visceral thing . <p> He 'd run his gang out along the decks , captain 's orders , as they needed to know how bad things were with the boats and hatches and rails . Most of them went on safety lines-the decks were slick , the air burned with sleet-but he and Quillian , a true Newfoundland bastard , went footsure and unfettered . They 'd discovered the worst , and he was on his way to report to the captain when he saw a man peering at him through a scleric portal . Henderson . Broad and searching in his foul weather gear , face pressed against the murky glass . He feared the cook wanted to volunteer for his crew , and he did not want that to happen . <p> He took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bosun would need a look at the number three hatch ; he 'd take him there . There was some relief in the orders that followed , the risks , the sleight of hand it would take to get through the remainder of the storm . There was a kind of march to the whole thing that he relished-a sailor 's muster and charge-all done to the drumbeat of weather and damage . <p> Quillian was waiting for him below deck , his face and cap beaded with melting sleet . " The Indian 's gone out there . I told him not to . " Quillian spoke with neither urgency nor judgment . Narrow talk , the speech of an islander . <p> " I 'll get him . He has some crazy idea about helping . " <p> " Do n't know about that , " Quillian said . " Had his duffel with him , like he meant to leave . " <p> He pushed his way out then . The deck lights flickered in the thick spray and wind , teasing his sense of balance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shallow trough , water spewing green and black across his face . They 'd been spared by the genius of the chief engineer so far , but if she caught beam seas again , caught them hard enough , the decks would be carried under . He looked midships for Henderson , thought again of the blackjacked look in the cook 's eyes when the passenger had sworn them off , and made his way down an accursedly icy ladder and aft . Henderson was on the fire crew . Maybe he was crazy enough to take his drill station . If he was still onboard at all . <p> He found him leaning over a beaten section of railing , sweeping his arms above the frenzied leap of water . Madness . Or an Indian thing , maybe . Or just madness . He 'd ask him to come back with him , to the galley for coffee , but if he would n't come , so be it . The lake knew her business . He did not move , however , when he saw Henderson lift his duffel-stuffed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bag went overboard , and while he waited a pitiless moment for Henderson to follow the duffel , it did not happen . The cook turned and saw him through the dim shower of spray and nodded , his rain hat tied tight beneath his squarish chin . It was as though he 'd known he was being watched . Henderson then passed by and made his way up the ladder with slow purpose . He followed the cook until he met up again with Quillian and the hard-pacing bosun . There were no words exchanged . They all went on with their jobs . <p> He did n't hear about the passenger until the next day . Awake for thirty hours until the weather broke , out dead for four hours ' sleep , then back into the crowded mess for some breakfast . He did n't hear about it from Henderson , who was preparing a sherry souffle for the captain , his apron starched flat , his black hair drawn into a neat , foreign-looking knot at the base of his skull . He heard it from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's cabin with dean towels and linens . The fellow was gone ; the cabin as tidy as a commander 's . They were looking for him in every bunk and locker , knowing how panic could make a rat out of any man , but some who 'd met him or seen him walking the decks before the storm did not expect to see him again . This was what the steward said , working the tale slowly around his soft Caribbean vowels , savoring it for the drinks that a longer , more lush version would someday buy . <p> He knew . And could feel the knowledge loop about him like a fresh manila line , connecting him hard to Henderson and that damnable yakking man . To Quillian , too , no doubt , though the Newfie would never speak of what he 'd seen , as he lived ancestrally in the gap between what he witnessed and what he needed to act upon . <p> Now , standing on a plain of sharded dark and light , at the edge of water and his land , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look Henderson in the eye after that moment . He could not recall what they 'd said to each other , though he knew they must have spoken-each of them-and let the words wrap the shroud on tight . Had they ever gone that far ? He knew well how the McCurdy had been towed back to Duluth by a Coast Guard vessel with a belligerent crew . He knew Henderson had left the ship , as all the crew did , off to sign onto other freighters while the McCurdy underwent repairs . Henderson in his massive pea jacket , his oft-healed hands , a neatly packed duffel like a rolled sail across his shoulder . They had said goodbye to one another in the usual brief way , as there were always things left unspoken when a man passed by another man . He remembered that he never questioned Henderson 's reasons . The passenger may have died on that pitching galley floor , or , good Christ , he may have begged to taste the saltless water of their particular sea . There had been a reason , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assembled heart that worked inside Henderson . <p> He walked onto the ice . First to where it laced around the lifeless rocks . Then to where the water of the bay deepened and he could have fished if he cared to and speared his share of whitefish and pike . Beyond , the ice grew thinner and might have groaned and pealed beneath him , but it did not . He went on , to the point where his canoe would begin to feel the draw of the great lake , its deep currents and cold logic . He would plant a hand-painted buoy when the ice broke , pay his delayed respects . The boy was out there , open-eyed and washed and preserved , a victim of risk and channel water , but all he could see were the pitiful man-lights that necklaced Mackinac and adorned her property . He turned back only when the wind rose from the black distance and drove into him , squalling with snow and bitterness . Only when he could be driven ashore like a sail with no good hull or keel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it was how his watery heart now worked within him . <p> 
##1003640 There were two women I thought might be able to help me , or rather help Lance , and that night , sitting on the bus on the way home from the hospital , I vowed to find one or both of them the next day , even if I had to cancel a couple of my afternoon classes to do it . There was always Sammy , of course , but I was anxious to keep him out of it because every hand up you get from Sammy today is one you wo n't be getting tomorrow . It does n't matter whether the stuff is for me , Lance , or Santa Claus-I 'm the one who 's asking so it 's going straight onto my balance sheet . Sammy shares the house with me and my son , Adam , and the Old Lady , the maid/nanny we pay to watch soap operas . <p> I should have been using the two-hour trip to grade papers , but I could n't face it , and the bus driver was weaving through traffic as though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so the back of the bus swung wildly across the lanes , making the passengers grab for the tops of seats to avoid being pitched into the aisle . With the kung fu movie blasting above my head and all the blank faces staring up at it while they spooned the dinners someone had prepared for them into their mouths , it was like being in twenty living rooms at once . I could n't wait to be inside my own house and enjoy the hour between getting there and going to bed that my home life had dwindled to since I started going to the hospital after work . I had barely laid eyes on Sammy in weeks , between my coming in late and him keeping stranger hours than usual , but I was just as happy to avoid him . I owed him a few baht for an advance he 'd given me-only an ounce or soand he was pissed off about a deal with a friend of mine who , he said , had screwed him over . I 've never met the man who could stiff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , that 's the end of it . No further discussion . <p> That left Sister Michael as my first choice of savior . She 's a nurse at the Seventh Day Adventist Hospital , where I 'd done one of my detoxes . I had long suspected she had a little thing for me , which would n't hurt . It would be tricky , though , because she was a toughie , the only ex-nun at Seventh Day who retained her male saint 's name when she went AWOL . Second and last resort was Noi , an ex-student of mine , but she would involve money changing hands . Since Angie left , I had n't been with anybody ( of course I ca n't properly say I was ever with Angie , but that 's a whole other story ) , but occasionally , when the money situation loosened up , I visited Noi down at Soi Cowboy where she worked . Noi had wanted to improve her English so she could actually converse with her customers beyond " You want hand fuck ? . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd signed up for my class . She even paid for it herself . We never actually did it , but I liked to share body heat with her , have her slip me the tongue . It was nothing seriousshe usually did n't even take out her chewing gum . Anyway , I knew Noi had connections and might be able to get me some prescription pills-stuff Lance would n't consider too low for him to stoop to-if she could skim a little off the top without her guy realizing . <p> I needed a wide variety-painkillers , barbiturates , Valium , whatever-since you never know exactly what 's going to work when they 're so far gone . The best would have been junk , but I knew Lance would never take it , even if I fixed him up , so it was useless to try persuading him that it would make everything feel better . It was an image thing-shooting just did n't fit in with his vision of himself . Lance saw himself as some other kind of person , the kind who would never ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do shoot primarily define themselves : Well , here I go again , because I 'm a junkie , and this is what we do , this is how we see ourselves . Give me a break . So far I 'd resisted the temptation to say , Are you the kind of person who imagined himself rotting in a scummy hospital in a slum outside of Bangkok ? Held hostage in a filthy bed at the mercy of a bunch of snotty nurses , the recipient of everyone 's scornful pity , a body that others avert their eyes from because it 's too painful for them to look at you ? Why screw everything up for someone who 's dying , anyway , all their years of hard work down the drain ? <p> I say work because you could tell right off when you met Lance just from the way he carried himself-before all this happened , I mean-that he had a very definite idea of how to present himself , Lance , to the world , and that it had taken him a very long time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a certain admiration for people who can do that , even though I do n't necessarily like them , and usually even dislike them . Here I am , a blind blob of something , a clam or an oyster that someone has torn from his shell-not necessarily to eat , possibly just for the hell of it-then tossed back into the water , where I bob along for all the world to see , waiting to be swamped by a wave or gobbled up by any old predator that comes along . And there those other people are , the Lances of the world , with their million layers of protection and self-definition , unreachable and impenetrable . It was n't until Lance got sick that I saw the slightest crack in his persona ; and even then he managed to keep up appearances for a good while . <p> One of the first , and one of the few , times I saw him lose it was about a month after he 'd been hospitalized . I 'd gone on a Saturday , which was rare because Saturday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adam on some outing , but the Old Lady 's niece and her spoiled kid were coming for the day , and I decided to clear out and pay Lance a surprise visit . Sammy was gone already , God knows where . Relations between me and Sammy had been deteriorating , which worried me a little , but I figured I 'd deal with it later , when there was more time . I knew he did n't like me visiting Lance so often , maybe just because it was a change and Sammy does n't like changes . Or maybe he had some Sammy-logic that was known only to his brain ; whatever the reason , he was out more and generally chillier when he was home-doing the crossword without me just to make a point , stuff like that . Anyway , since there was no patching up to be done that morning , I thought I 'd keep Lance company , bring some work with me , see how things were going there , and maybe if he felt good enough , we 'd play a game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopeless at the game-in the hospital , at least , he had no heart for it . Maybe it was too reminiscent of the fact that he had no move to make for himself now-whatever control , at least by legal methods , he could have had over the situation probably evaporated as soon as they got him into that hospital . <p> The hall was empty , per usual . Lance was in a ward the staff worked hard to avoid . The receptionist had nodded me in , recognizing me by now , although she rarely looked me in the face . He did n't have many visitors ; even the other gay men in our office could n't bring themselves to come more than once or twice . <p> I knocked and then opened the door gently , so as not to startle him . He looked at me through puffy eyes , like he 'd been crying for some time , and his cheeks still had sleep crinkles from the coarse pillowcase . Both activities were so recently represented on his face , he could only have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I said . <p> He looked at me vaguely , then , after a few seconds , like he knew who I was . " Did you just get here ? What are you doing here ? It 's Saturday . " <p> " I know . " I put my papers down on the floor and sat in the only chair . There was absolutely nothing to look at in the room but each other . " Thought I could inveigle you into some chess . " His face looked so distraught , and was such a contrast to his normally composed features , that I had to look away ; staring at the floor was preferable , despite the presence of a metal bowl next to his bed that he had vomited into during the night and no one had come to take away . I was about to get up and rinse it in the sink , so I would n't have to smell the odor , and to make myself busy while he got under control , when Lance said , " I was dreaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago-the worst dream I ever had . " His mouth looked like he was going to cry more . He must have become conscious of his lower lip trembling because he chewed on one side of it for a second . " It was a dream that I had AIDS , and I was in the hospital , and no one would come visit me . And if they did come , they just stared at me through a little glass window in the door of my room and would n't enter . No one would touch me . " <p> I muttered , " Oh , no , that 's not . . I 'm sure . . . , " something I thought would be comforting , but he spoke over me , which was probably for the best because I had launched into a sentence without really having a plan for where it was going . <p> " I lay in bed , and I could see different people 's faces at the little window , my brother and my parents , and then random dream people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was crying and crying , saying over and over , I 'm so lonely , I 'm so lonely . But you know what the worst part was ? " He was talking so quickly , a ragged breath every now and then obliterating a word entirely , he would n't have heard a response if I 'd made one . " When I woke up , I could n't remember if I had it or not . I lay in bed not knowing for about ten minutes , before I figured out that I was perfectly healthy . And that 's what happened to me this morning , too . Only I woke up in this shithole instead of my bed , which was my first tip-off . But I still was n't sure , I thought maybe I was really here for something else , you know like a hernia operation " -he almost laughed , but it was swallowed up in a sob- " and a bad night in the hospital had given me an anxiety dream . It took me a few minutes to realize that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's worse . " <p> I was silent . Any words of comfort would have sounded fatuous and artificial , and I was a little caught off-guard seeing Lance weep so openly . I had barely even seen him scowl , before the hospital . Of course he was n't the same since , essentially , being locked up to die , but most of the time he managed to carry off an almost collusive air , as though it were all happening to someone else . Like he was on the side doing the pitying , and the pity-ee was a third , invisible party in the room that we had to be careful not to allude to in any way , lest we offend him . I got up to put the bowl in the sink , hating the noticeably heavy footfall of my bad leg as I crossed the room and how the tap of my cane on the linoleum gave a syncopated rhythm to the sounds that were coming from the bed . <p> With a name like Lance Potter , you almost have to go in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lance was striving for the latter but fell short , headlong into that middle ground , which is where you run into trouble . His natural tendency was to be a little snarky , but he tried to disguise it under a patina of false good will . It was n't just that he was insincere , it was something physical ; even his good looks were fakey . In fact , it was the day I ran into him at Bobby 's Arms , when he was still healthy , or at least still looked healthy , that I finally figured out what about him had been nagging at me ever since I 'd first met him . <p> I was surprised to see Lance at Bobby's-the place was n't his style . Bobby 's is musty and moribund , full of farang doing their best to escape the crud of Bangkok : the heat and glaring sun , the choking fumes . Bobby 's was one of the few places that catered to foreigners but not tourists , which meant bar girls were n't constantly thrusting themselves in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Still , Lance claimed to avoid farang ghettos like the plague , though I 'd heard he frequented some of the raunchier boy bars in town-places like The Saloon , where patrons could fire blanks at little boys onstage whose job it was to duck for cover behind cardboard horses and saguaro cacti , and Club zi , where teenagers were led around in chains . The rumor mill also had it that he lived with a young Thai kid . Then again , I 'd heard gossip that I went down to Klong Toey and hustled with the drag junkies , so who knows , maybe it was all bull . <p> I myself went to Bobby 's to play chess , but Lance preferred games like go-fish and gin , where you could bluff , not the all-out war that chess involves . What most people fail to understand about chess is that it is n't a game . Even the most minute weakness of the opponent has to be immediately exploited , until he 's backed into a corner , trapped , and killed . Lance tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little detente moves that were the end of him . The men who played at Bobby 's were almost all vets from Vietnam or Korea , so they understood this aspect of the game . Most of them had married Thai women , ex-bar girls who now ran little export businesses or restaurants , and the men still talked and acted like they were on leave , kind of a permanent R &R.; <p> And Bobby 's was quiet . Even the cacophony from the street did n't seep in there-it was much quieter than our house , where punks on motorcycles roared by at all hours and vendors screamed up and down the street , until you went out and bought something just so they 'd shut up and move on . The door at Bobby 's was four-inch-thick wood , and there were only a couple of tiny thick-paned windows , set way up high in the wall like in a dungeon . <p> The afternoon I saw Lance there , he was sitting at a table reading , his head bent and chin resting on his palm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little squares of glass overhead , making his hair shine . I remember thinking he was probably reading one of the incredibly trashy books he favored-he had the worst taste in entertainment of anyone I 'd ever met-and then I recall noticing , as I watched him unobserved for a few seconds , that he had colored his hair . I was very surprised , shocked almost , because he was only about thirty-five and his slightly pudgy baby face , always completely hairless-not even the shadow of a beard-made him look even younger . His brown hair was darker around his ears than on top , and in the soft beam from the window , it had a brassy red overlay , a metallic sheen that could only have been the product of a dye . Suddenly his fresh-faced health looked like something that was perfectly fine on top but , when you turned it over with your shoe , was all rotten underneath . <p> Just then he looked up from his book and waved me over , polite as always . He kicked the chair across from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What are you doing here , Francis ? " he said , cracking the spine of his book gruesomely so it would stay flat-fortunately it was only The Bad Seed . I stretched my leg out and leaned my cane against the wall . <p> " Getting out of this heat , maybe pick up a chess game . And you ? What are you doing here ? I come here with J.C . all the time and we 've never seen you here . " J.C . was one of the other teachers who could n't stand Lance , and Lance knew it . <p> " Just reading . I have n't seen J.C . in weeks , I thought maybe he 'd been fired . " He smiled one of his noxious **29;751;TOOLONG smiles . " I 'm teaching at the Daiwa Bank tonight , on Soi 4 . It 's right around the corner . " Daiwa was one of the plum jobs the Institute tossed us-teaching English at night to a bunch of bankers . Good money , eager students-a breeze . I 'd taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole fiasco about my contract , they 'd given it to Lance . I did n't know if he was the one who had ratted to our department head , Achara-also known as the Viper-about my little habit , but I had a strong suspicion . He knew that piece of information would get him a perk somewhere down the line . In the end , nothing much came of it except that I had to produce a doctor 's certificate saying I was dean before the university would renew my teaching contract . An Australian friend of Sammy 's did it for five hundred baht , but I resented everybody knowing about it and having to spend the money . <p> " I know where it is ; ' I said . <p> Lance laughed nervously . " Oh , right . " He picked up his book and waved it enthusiastically . " Have you read this ? It 's greatreally gripping . " <p> " No . " <p> " I 'll lend it to you if you want , when I 'm done . I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's okay ; ' I said . " I 'm in the middle of a few things . " We chatted for a few more minutes , and then he rather awkwardly got up to leave . Maybe he felt bad about the job . " Can we play chess sometime ? " he said . " You can teach me . But you 're probably really good , right ? " <p> I shrugged . " Sure , if you like . " I was hoping I 'd never have the opportunity . What I really wanted was to come out and ask him directly about the Viper , but then I decided with a liar as smooth as Lance , you 'd never know for sure unless he was ready to tell you . He was waving goodbye before I had a chance to change my mind , and I was glad to be free of his babble about what he had watched on video the night before-ten episodes of The Golden Girls , all at once . His favorite was the one where Betty White asks one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband died to do it with another man , and she says , " Till the paramedics got there . " I was to hear that countless times in the next few months , and it never amused him any less . No matter how often he told you , he 'd slap his leg and laugh , the corners of his mouth wet with saliva . <p> Lance left for the bank , and I stayed and played a few hours of chess before going home to the kiln that was our house in summer . I tried to stay out at least until the sun went down . When I pulled open the heavy wooden door to leave Bobby 's , it was dusk and as hot out as it had been at noon . I 've always loved twilight in the tropics . It comes and goes quickly , and then it 's dark , not that lingering murk you get farther north . The light everywhere was soft and consistent , padding Bangkok in a thick gray blanket streaked with purples and pinks . I felt as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see it changing wavelengths , speeding up and slowing down as it passed through different media-metal , glass , air . An upstairs room across the alley looked like it was deep under the ocean where the sun penetrates just enough so that you can make out shapes but nothing has edges or shadows . There was a mobile with angelfish on it hanging in the window , and the evening breeze was moving the fish around so it looked like they had taken over the place-flooded everything and kicked out the people . <p> For some reason , that twenty minutes at Bobby 's with Lance had allowed the thought into my head that it might be possible , under the right circumstances , to get an honest answer out of him , and I wanted to know badly , irrationally , if he had been the one who had gone to Achara and violated the farang solidarity in our department . Maybe noticing that he dyed his hair made him seem vulnerable to me for the first time . Later , when I thought about it , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers or read to him , and sometimes even tried to let him beat me at chess , I realized that I had n't asked that day at Bobby 's because I could n't stand to hear him lie about it . That was the beginning of me wanting Lance to tell me the truth , even if I had to wait a long time for that to happen . <p> Lance lied by second nature . I did n't believe most of the stories he told when we all sat around the teachers ' lounge swapping anecdotes . In the hospital he seemed different , but then again , why would he lie to me about his childhood , about people I had never met and never would meet ? Sometimes I wondered , though . Before he got sick he was often sarcastic , but not openly like the other expats , which was for humor or to tease . Lance 's cynicism was slyer , masquerading as an overly polite veneer that mocked by its very inappropriateness . His manner put off the other Americans most of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he actually thought you believed he was for real . It was hard not to stop him in the middle of one of his archly delivered jokes and say , Do n't pull this on me . Some putz from Perth or Liverpool might fall for it , but I know your kind , and there 's millions just like you where you came from . The suburbs are oozing with Lance Potters . But I 'll give him this . Now and then , when he laughed that ironic laugh , not the bogus hearty chuckle he forced for the Thai teachers ' sake , the name Lance seemed perfect for him-undercutting not just everything that touched him , but himself , too . <p> He must have actually succeeded at being the boy next door when he was a kid-hell , he probably believed it himself-at least until it became apparent his interest in the other boy next door was outstripping his interest in the girl next door . Even then , Lance was smart enough to know that would n't sit well with the good folks of Chippewa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so dear by his parents and neighbors , he bided his time till he could escape , and once he was gone , he was gone for good . There are probably little old ladies in Chippewa Falls who still get a warm glow when they think about the boy from church who shoveled snow off the walk so they would n't fall and break their brittle backs , maybe freeze to death inches from their porches on the outskirts of Chippewa proper . That was the image Lance had been trying to project , at least at first , as if that could save him , as if even a disease could be disarmed by boyish charm . Later , when there was no hiding how sick he was , he could n't quite give it up completely , which was why I think he never let me contact his family . I do n't know if they would have come , or tried to get him sent home , or what . Instead , I was the last person he was withme , someone who only a few months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . <p> The bus driver craned his head backward so he could see the movie , too , and the bus narrowly missed swiping a telephone pole . Packages that had been balanced on laps went crashing to the floor around me . I thought that this night was probably one of the last times I 'd visit Lance . He was going downhill quickly , and I was n't sure how much more he could stand ; pharmacological intervention was definitely called for . It would be doing us both a favor . He 'd been pretty out of it for about a week and was barely speaking at all . When he made any noise , it was usually a moan of pain , though he still looked at me and seemed to follow if I said something . The last exchange we 'd had that could be called a conversation was three days earlier , when he 'd woken from a restless sleep , bathed in sweat from his dreams and the oppressively dense , unmoving air in his room . <p> " Francis ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For the past few days he 'd been calling me Joey , his dead brother . I said , " Mm-hmm , I have n't left yet , " though I 'd been thinking that I should get going-I was falling asleep over my papers and I had a full load of teaching the next day . " Did I tell you , when I was a kid . , " he went on , in such a weak voice I could barely understand him , " I had a paper route . My favorite thing was to deliver the paper on holidays or Sundays , so early that everyone was still asleep . I 'd get on my bike around quarter of six , and I felt like I was the only one who was awake and on top of things . Like I owned the whole town . " He stopped and rested , wheezing audibly , and I waited for him to go on . This was the most he 'd said at one time in days . " I used to throw the paper , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doormat perfectly square , so when Mr. or Mrs. whoever came out , the paper would be exactly parallel to the door . " <p> " That was nice of you , " I said . " Very thoughtful . Quite the perfectionist ' <p> He raised his head slightly to look at me . I could see a big wet spot on the pillowcase where sweat from the back of his neck had dampened it . " Can you believe that shit ? " he said . " I actually cared that the paper lay just right on the porch . " <p> I shook my head . I 'd had a paper route for a little while , but got fired because one too many irate husbands called and complained that the paper was n't there , or it was late . I always swore to my boss I 'd delivered it on time , but after a while he canned me anyway . <p> " You tell me , " Lance said , letting his head fall back onto the dingy pillowcase , " how I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " <p> I said no , I could n't . Somehow Lance 's not knowing how he 'd gotten there seemed preferable to the line that led so directly between my getting the axe at The Beachcomber , the weekly newspaper , and my present situation . <p> " I was saving up " he said , " to buy the Star of Africa . I was going to be known as The Man Who Owned the Star of Africa , and everyone in Chippewa Falls could say I had been their paper boy . " <p> I did n't tell him I had no idea what the Star of Africa was , and that if I did n't , you could bet no one in Chippewa Falls did , either . <p> The hospital they 'd moved Lance to was about two and a half hours north of the city , and by the time I reached home , it was almost eleven , and I was exhausted . The Old Lady had left some unidentifiable mush out for me , and there were flies all over it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bowl right before she went up to bed and after the food had evidently been sitting out long enough for the flies to really embed themselves in it . I gave it a miss and ate a piece of toast with bananas and butter . <p> That day , I 'd had a big fight with one of the nurses because she would n't change Lance 's IV often enough ; instead of switching it when the bag was almost empty , she 'd slow it down to the tiniest drip-the least amount of fluid you could allow out without letting any air into the vein . I found it difficult to eat after staring at that bag all evening . Although at least when Lance was on IVs I did n't have to worry about his food source . Before , when he was still eating solids , the nurses refused to bring his tray into the room . They left it outside the door until I got there , so whatever it was to begin with had congealed and been covered with dirt kicked up by people shuffling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Lady make extra so I could bring it in to work with me and go straight to the hospital when I finished teaching . The Old Lady was crabby about doing more cooking-if you could call it that-and she took it out on my son , the Gripper , who cried more , so Sammy was crabbier , and the result was that my life at home was a living hell . <p> The nurses let Lance sit in a dirty bedpan for hours , so half the time I cleaned it-and him-myself rather than smell the stench . He 'd turn his head away , embarrassed , but it did n't bother me much . I 've seen junkies do the same to themselves , and worse . The rare occasions anyone else from our office came to the hospital , they did n't stay long . You could tell from the expressions on their faces-suddenly they were all such fastidious creatures-that the sights and smells were too much for them . They were thinking that they 'd rather be dead than sink that low . but it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every one of them would be begging and praying for another day to live , just the way Lance was . <p> Of course , they resented me for making them look like cowards and spread malicious rumors about me to make themselves feel better . Everyone in the office had one ally who told them all the crap everyone else said about them ; after Angie left , mine was a young thing from Maryland who never wanted to upset me , but I usually managed to wheedle out of her the rumors that had been poured into her perfect little shell of an ear . <p> This particular set of slanders , however , was even worse than I 'd imagined , and she repeated them to me in a shocked whisper , as if my hearing them at a lower volume would make them less hurtful : that I was a voyeur , that I had tested positive already and I was preparing for what was coming , trying to figure out how to get around in that hospital system-that I was in effect considering Lance 's death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I 'd ever be stupid enough to let myself fall into the clutches of the people who 'd gotten their hands on Lance . I guess it made our colleagues feel better about their own behavior to see mine in that light . The gay ones were probably scared shitless the hospital would grab them and lock them up , the way they 'd gotten Lance . <p> First , Lance had gone to a regular hospital , a ritzy private one , to check out a cough that had been hanging on for weeks . After the pneumonia diagnosis , they tested him without telling him , and next thing he knew , he was being strapped into an ambulance and whisked away to a special " high security " hospital up-country , even though he said he felt fine . After all , he 'd had only a mild bout , but there the ward doors were locked and they would n't let him leave . <p> When Lance called me that Sunday morning , after spending the weekend in the hospital , he did n't let on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his voice , partly because no one in Bangkok relies on telecommunication , so the phone hardly ever rings , and because Lance was n't one of the few people who called me at home . I 'm still not sure why he called me particularly . I guess he knew there were certain things about my lifestyle that precluded me judging other people 's . <p> When I put the phone to my ear , the background was crackly , and I could hear high-pitched giggles coming over another line we 'd intersected . " Francis ? It 's Lance , " he said in his self-confident way , emphasizing his name in case I did n't know who he was . " Lance Potter . " As if he were a salesman and he wanted to be sure I remembered him later . <p> I said , " Yeah , I know . Hi , Lance . What 's up ? " Our conversation sounded more stilted and awkward because of the voices laughing over it . I wondered if they could hear us , too . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pause , while he tried to figure out if the laughter was coming from my apartment . " I guess there are n't that many Lances in Bangkok , " he said , and chuckled a little too heartily . <p> " Just enough , " I said laughing a little as well , but not very enthusiastically . " So . . . what 's up ? " I did n't want to be rude in case he had called just to say hello , though I knew it was improbable , but I wanted him to get to the point . <p> " So , I need a favor . Would you mind ? " <p> " Depends what it is , does n't it ? " I had n't forgotten about that whole other thing , with my doctor 's certificate . <p> " Oh , it 's no big deal , " he said quickly . " Can you just tell Achara tomorrow morning that I wo n't be in for a few days ? I tried to call her at home , but her phone must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Where are you ? Stuck out of town ? Did you suddenly fall in love with a village beauty ? " Lance was n't really out at work , though everyone knew he was gay , so sometimes I liked to give him a little jab about it , to keep him on his toes . He humored me with a dry snort . In the background I heard an announcement paging someone , and then I knew instantly Lance was in the hospital . I think I even knew why , though nothing in his voice betrayed it . <p> " Oh , right , that 's what I meant to tell you . I 'm quitting ! No , I 'm in the hospital , in Siriwan . I had one of those intestinal things , and they 're running some tests to make sure they got it all . Must have been one of those crabs they fish out of the sewers and dish up at the Goethe Institute Sunday brunch . " He lied without missing a beat . <p> It was n't until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that I realized how difficult it must have been for him to feign cheerfulness on the phone that day . After we 'd hung up , he 'd called his boyfriend to tell him he had been involuntarily removed to a different hospital , and on top of that , they were n't letting him go home to get clothes and books , and could the boyfriend-I never heard Lance say his name or mention him except to tell me thisplease bring Lance a few things he needed , and he never heard from the guy again . By the time I went over to Lance 's place to get some of his stuff , the boyfriend was long gone . He 'd cleaned the place out-Lance 's expensive stereo , the microwave and American blender a friend had brought him , his VCR-but there was no point in telling Lance . I knew he 'd never get back there to find out for himself . <p> By Monday afternoon , the whole office knew because when I told Achara that Lance was in Siriwan Hospital , she put two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much for patient confidentiality ; I guess the place already had a rep to Thais as a containment vessel . I do n't know if Achara had the clout to get him out , but she did n't seem too inclined to try . So much for him ponying me up in return for everlasting favors from the Viper . Maybe she thought that 's where he belonged , or at least as much as any other poor bastard who ended up there . <p> Lots of the other patients were bar girls and boys , and junkies into the bargain , since rich people or ones with well-connected relatives knew better than to entrust themselves to any government hospital . If one of them got it , General somebody-or-other 's eldest son , say , who 'd made a few too many trips to the cathouse , well , he was kept at home , with private nurses . At Siriwan , people with lethal infectious diseases were all lined up next to one another in the same room , on cots a few feet apart , hacking up sputum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedsides . Thanks to a high level of xenophobia , Lance had his own private cubicle with a door and everything . Then , AIDS was still being treated as a farang disease , so any foreigners who had it were despised as bringers of death upon an innocent people . <p> When I finished my toast , I went upstairs to look in on my son . The Gripper , as I call him , had strewn toys , books , tin cans , all over the floor in the hallway separating his room from Sammy 's but I was too tired to do anything about it , even though I knew Sammy would give me hell about the mess . The Old Lady had nothing to do now that the kid was in pre-school half the day , but that did n't seem to result in the house being any cleaner . I opened the door as quietly as I could and saw the Gripper asleep , one little hand , still wet from sucking his thumb , curled up on the Old Lady 's wrinkled , sagging breast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in days . After Suchada , Adam 's mother , left , the Old Lady started sleeping with the Gripper because his was the only airconditioned room in the house . I still slept downstairs on the mattress where I 'd been sleeping ever since Suchada kicked me out of the bedroom when the Gripper was born . <p> I borrowed Sammy 's radio from the kitchen and put it next to my head to listen to the BBC world news hour , then fell asleep still dressed but minus my boots . I was so wiped out , I dropped off without my last fix of the night , but into more of a nap than a deep sleep , where I was half-awake and knew I was dreaming but could n't put a stop to it . I dreamt I was looking at a picture of myself , and the picture was of me looking at a picture , and that picture was of me , and on and on . Then in my dream I woke up , and I knew , more clearly than I had ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but what is recorded of every thought , every act , is pure chance . Evolution only creates a series of altered appearances , a catalogue of ever-changing symptoms . <p> Still dreaming that I was awake , I looked at the picture I held in my hand , and the face in it changed from mine to Lance 's , and I knew he was dead . My body filled up with a fear so palpable , it seeped into my lungs and turned them into two smooth oval stones , dense as diamonds . In the picture , Lance began to yawn , and his mouth became a gaping black hole stretched across his face , into which some invisible hand was pouring his death , a dark liquid which surged down his throat with a power all its own , like a black horse running , then disappeared , to wait and hide inside us until it was ready to come out . A British man 's voice was saying over and over , The Star of Africa , the Star of Africa , and when I awoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my sweaty cheek off the vinyl of my sleeping mat . The newscaster 's voice was buzzing tinnily in my ear about an uprising in South Africa , and for a disoriented second I thought there was someone in the room with me . The air was still and roasting , and I was soaked , but the premonition had turned my lips cold and my skin clammy . My hands were shaking so much I could barely get the needle in . Poor Lance . His crumbling body was proof of what no expat likes to admit : no matter how far away you get , it 's never far enough . <p> I was sure when I set out the next day after work that when I got to the hospital , one of the slaggy nurses would tell me Lance had gone during the night . I stopped by Seventh Day anyway , just in case , hoping to catch Sister Michael as she was getting off shift . I figured I could always use the stuff myself if it was too late for Lance . Most people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital to the next , but I 've never minded hospitals ; maybe because strange behavior is barely noticed in them , or is explained away by strange circumstances . In fact , I find them vaguely relaxing . In hospitals , nobody stares at me because I walk with a cane and a limp . It makes me feel at home , as though I were there for rehabilitation . <p> Sure enough , Sister Michael was at the main registration desk , filling out her paperwork . She looked up when I cleared my throat , then smiled when she saw it was me . She seemed genuinely pleased . <p> " Hello , Francis , " she said . " What brings you here ? Pleasure , I hope . " <p> " Business , I 'm afraid , " I said . " But not for me . I 'm fine . " <p> " Fine in what sense ? " she went on in the same tone , as though we were exchanging pleasantries . " Still alive and working eighty hours a week to support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again ? " <p> I never knew how she could tell just by looking at me that I had n't quit . Maybe she still had some connections to the powers that be , left over from her nun days . I nodded to acknowledge her position , the worthlessness of my present life , etc. , etc . It 's not that I disagreed with her , in the abstract I agreed entirely , but principle and practice are two different things . At least I was n't in Lance 's shoes . <p> The last time I 'd seen her was several months earlier , when one of my friend Patrick 's smuggling schemes had backfired and two condoms filled with junk burst in his colon on the way to the airport . Inferior Thai rubber , I guess-could n't stand up to those intestinal enzymes . He was probably spared years in jail , because he looks exactly like the kind of person who would try a scheme like that . The taxi driver saved his life ; when he checked the rearview mirror and saw Patrick slumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chin , he turned around and took him straight to Seventh Day . Sister Michael was the one who phoned me-she figured anyone in Patrick 's condition with a Bangkok address in his passport had bumped into me or Sammy somewhere along the line . She was becoming kind of the matron saint of the Bangkok junk circuit . <p> " I have this friend . . . , ' I said , getting right to the point and seeing immediately by the set of her face she did n't believe me . " He 's really sick . " I also knew she knew " sick " meant " I 'm not getting enough , and I need something else to take up the slack , " and I let her think it was for me . <p> Sister Michael sighed . " Will you promise to come back before the end of the year ? " she said . " If you do , I 'll see to you personally . " <p> " I 'll try . But- " I rubbed my thumb and first two fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just do n't have any . But I 'm working on something . I 'm putting something together . " Seventh Day was one of the only places that had a real detox program , not the kind where they rope you to the bed and leave you there , but it was also the most expensive . I 'd gone through it once , when Suchada was pregnant with the Gripper , but she had paid for it . That was the agreement , she would n't end the pregnancy if I would straighten up . About three months before Adam was due , not long after I got out of the program , Suchada came home one day and found Patrick at the house and lost it completely . I was n't supposed to hang out with my old friends , the ones who were still using . After calling Patrick all sorts of names and kicking him out on his ass , she left , and I did n't hear from her for two days . When she returned she was pale and silent and spent a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had the baby anyway , and he was fine . I knew she 'd gone to one of her mother 's herbal doctors , but what could I say ? She would just scream that I had n't kept up my end of the bargain , and there was no reasoning with her . After those fights I usually had to rescue my books and papers from the sodden heaps on the lawn they accumulated into when Suchada threw them out the window . <p> Sister Michael stared at me evenly , as if she were reading my mind and knew I was thinking about spells and hexes and other things I should be leaving to forces she considered to be marshaled on the side of good . You could n't put anything over on that woman . Her cheeks were pink , skin perfectly clear-she practically glowed with health . " Hold on , " she said . " I 'll be off in a few minutes . " <p> When she reappeared in her street clothes-perfectly ironed , surprisingly close-fitting jeans , a maroon silk blouse , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a Styrofoam carton in it that could have held her lunch . She waited until we were outside to hand it to me . " This is the last time , " she said . " You understand that , do n't you ? " The look on her face let me know I had pushed her far enough . <p> I did n't peek in the bag until we had parted and I was on the long bus ride headed toward Lance . I felt like I had just gotten off that bus , and there I was right back on it . Since this was the last hurrah , as it were , Sister Michael had gone all out and arranged a whole sampler . There were at least twenty-five pills inside the carton , all different shapes and colors , even a few I did n't recognize . I emptied them into the bag and ditched the Styrofoam , then folded up the baggie tightly and put it into my pocket . It was all I could do not to skim a couple for my own rainy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming down the pike from that direction , but I knew I was warm and dry compared to Lance . There was also a piece of pink phone-message paper folded in the bag , and I opened it and read in her perfect , Jesuitschool handwriting : <p> I am a follower of Jesus Christ but I know I have brought shame to His name many times . He does n't ask that I be perfect , but He does want me to be honest about my mistakes . And then , farther down the page , And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire : and them that had gotten the victory over the beast , and over His image , and over His mark , and over the number of His name , stand on the sea of glass , having the harps of God . <p> I refolded the paper and put in my breast pocket . No need for Lance to see that . He 'd grown up as an Episcopal altar boy , and it still haunted him , that vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it overhead , bearing the burden for the entire congregation while the priest intoned the week 's reading . <p> I stopped by the reception desk and said Lance Potter , fully expecting the receptionist-a new one I 'd never seen before-to shake her head , meaning it was over , but she gave a bored nod and gestured with her chin for me to go ahead . On the way down the hall I saw Vini , my least favorite nurse . She must have gone into the profession to escape some terrible fate awaiting her as a beautiful young Indian woman , because she did n't have an ounce of compassion in her body . At least , not for humans . She did like animals , though , and was hiding some orphaned , worm-ridden kittens in one of the supply closets , feeding them and giving them medicine she 'd pilfered from the hospital . I had to pass the closet on my way to Lance 's room , and sure enough she was holding something carefully in her hands-a bowl of milk with bread floating in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of two mangy little tabbies with infected eyes swollen shut with pus . Vini had n't heard me . As she put the bowl on the floor , she said in , for her , a cheerful tone , " Eat , you blind fools ! " I 'd hung my cane over my arm and tried to walk lightly , but she finally realized someone was there and straightened up quickly , tugging her uniform down over her lovely hips and turning around with an annoyed scowl . <p> I was n't totally convinced the staff would even know if Lance had died , so I opened the door slowly and peered around it . His body was still hooked up to the machines and the IV dripdripped away , stingily as ever . His eyes were half-open , and his teeth showed where his upper lip was pulled back a little , as if he were thinking about something slightly amusing . <p> " Lance ... , " I said , leaning over the bed . " It 's me . " I patted my breast pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something good for you in my pocket . Truly . " <p> I reached over and touched his face , just to make sure , and his cheek was hot and dry . He opened his eyes the rest of the way and looked at me then , and even tried to smile a little . " Can you swallow ? " I asked , but he made no response . <p> Lance had all his teeth capped when he got to Bangkok because , he said , it was so cheap , and afterward he showed them off with toothy grins and silly crude little jokes that the Thai teachers did n't quite get but laughed at anyway , not realizing he was making fun of them . He never said Thailand , but always " The Land of Smiles " -the slogan the Government had used to kick off the promotion for the Year of the Tourist-and when he said it , he oozed that grin in your direction . " Oh boy " Lance would say , shaking his head in supposed sadness , " another factory burnt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smiles ! " Cluck-cluck went his tongue . What a shame . Tsk-tsk . <p> Lance was neat and clean-shaven and every day his shirts were ironed and bleached-he made the rest of us look like vagabonds when we came in with razor stubble , wearing the same rumpled shirt and tie as the day before . That and a lot of ass-kissing ensured him the best courses and the most profitable outside work . Most of the Thai teachers were on somewhat shaky ground as far as their English was concerned , even though we all taught in the Language department , and they badgered the foreign staff all day with minute questions of grammar and usage . When one pretty young Thai teacher asked Lance shortly after the Reagan polyp disclosure , " Could you say Ronald Reagan is a cancerous president ? " and he took it , it was too much-even though we 'd all voted absentee for our favorite write-in candidates . Most expats do n't see a contradiction between their rabid patriotism and the fact that they ca n't even stand their home countries enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lance was the exception-he had no loyalty to anything or anyone , as far as we could determine . He started to answer , but Paul , a seventy-year-old Irish Republican pothead from Chicago , leaped from his chair and said , " Yes , you can , you can say that because in America you can say whatever you want about our leaders no matter how degrading or insulting it is , because it 's a free society , " and stomped out of the teachers ' lounge . A few days earlier , some lowly PM. had been thrown in jail under lese majesty for saying he wished he 'd been born a prince . When Paul was gone , Lance lifted his perfect eyebrows and shrugged at me , then turned his attention back to the teacher as though nothing had happened . She was smiling nervously , though she had certainly meant it as a jab . Still , no one was supposed to get that ruffled . <p> Does it seem odd that I 've remembered so clearly the details of this and other perfectly unremarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that accompanied them , that I can pinpoint the beginning of wanting to make Lance tell me the truth to the moment I noticed he dyed his hair ? At the time I was puzzled by that myself , but I 've come to suspect , since the blurry string of nights listening to Lance whisper-stopping often to rest , trying to make do on the little puffs of breath his clogged lungs could provide-his recollections of childhood and relatively short adulthood , so that someone on earth would know what had meant something to him , that memory does n't weed out what 's important . Is n't it just as likely that we confer meaning on things because they were remembered ? Thus the most ordinary conversations and events-an outing with our parents , an item of clothing that at the time meant nothing more to us than a way to hide our bare and embarrassing skin from the world-become laden with meaning simply because they happened to lodge in our memories . And that which is forgotten is , necessarily , consigned to insignificance . <p> I became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand why Lance had remembered some occasion , say a car trip with his mother and brother where he and his brother had sung everything they wanted to say-Ro-oll down the win-do-ow pulee-eze , Mo-om , can we ge-et some ay-yus cream pu-lee-eze-until their mother had pulled over the car and sobbed behind the wheel , begging them to stop . It turned out , Lance added as an afterthought ( the reason for the trip having taken a back seat in his memory to the fact they 'd made their mother cry ) , that they were driving across country because their mother had packed them up and left their father in the middle of a hot summer night , after which Lance never saw his father again . <p> He remembered that he was at a restaurant called The Blue Bottle and that he was holding a glass of red wine in his hand when a plainclothes policeman approached the table , knelt down beside his chair , and told him he had to go home because his brother had shot himself in the head . He described how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and said he remembered thinking that the stain would spread out forever until the purple pool engulfed him and the entire table . But he did n't remember whom he 'd been eating with , nor the substance of his final conversation with his brother , or when they 'd last seen each other . <p> Once , when I was at Lance 's apartment getting him some fresh clothes and checking his mail , I picked up a photo lying on the floor with the contents of a drawer that had been turned upside down by his boyfriend when he 'd ransacked the place . ( Whoever had done it , besides removing everything of value , had erased any trace of himself from the apartment . ) For some reason , probably fear of karmic retribution , the landlord had n't evicted Lance , though as far as I knew the rent was n't being paid . <p> The photograph was of a boy standing next to the burned-out shell of a small house , his hands stretched toward the picture taker and , on his face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? expression . If it were n't for the expression , I would have taken the boy for Lance , their features were so similar , but on the back someone had written 196o , Joey after the fire . That night at the hospital , through a series of roundabout questions-I did n't want Lance to know his ex-boyfriend had trashed the apartment and scattered the remains of Lance 's life around on the floor-I managed to elicit the information that his brother had started a chimney fire by putting too much wrapping paper in the fireplace on Christmas morning , and the house had burned to the ground . When the firemen got there , they discovered that the house , part of a development , had been built on soil that was too soft and the foundation had settled and crushed the underground pipes . The house was ashes before they could locate another water source . I 'm positive Lance never would have told me this if I had n't worked him around to it with probing questions about houses and fires , yet he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his father had given him a rabbit for Christmas-which every year he 'd named Sarah , regardless of its gender-and every year , Sarah died long before the next Christmas rolled around . And he knew exactly where every one of those dead rabbits-at least the ones whose bodies had been recovered-was buried . Not " in the yard " or " near the woodpile " but under what kind of tree , how far from the house , whether the maimed little corpse was in a coffin-usually a shoe box-and so on . It strained credulity , except I could n't think of one reason why anyone would pretend to remember information like that if he really did n't . <p> It was n't until a few nights before Lance died that I understood the implications of this randomness : the world can never become an appreciably better place . A memory that does n't function to select significant events means one can never learn from one 's mistakes . Any changes for the better are coincidental and occur with more or less the same frequency as any changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a cover headline screaming Can History Stop Repeating Itself ? , as if our own tiny , miserable lives were n't answer enough . <p> I pressed Lance 's hand and said , " Do n't try to talk , okay ? I 'll just sit here for a while . " He twisted his mouth like he was going to try to say something anyway . A feeding tube that was n't attached to any food dangled from his nose , waving slightly like an upside-down antenna when he moved his head . <p> I sat down and started grading papers , hoping just my presence was of some comfort . I was conscious of all those pills in my pocket , the promise of each one pressing its shape into my chest . Lance seemed to be beyond whatever comfort any pill might provide , and I was scared to put anything in his mouth he could choke on . Probably the most merciful thing would have been to grind them all up into powder , dissolve them in water , and shoot the paste down the feeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozed off for a few minutes , because when I woke up , I had the vague sensation of being watched . Lance 's lips had dried blood on them around the outsides and at the corners of his mouth , like he 'd been sucking on a blood Popsicle . When he parted them , I could see the inside of his mouth was white and spongy-looking from thrush . I 'd heard horror stories about it growing out of people 's mouths uncontrollably , like cotton candy . <p> " Can you understand me ? " I asked . " Do you want anything ? " <p> He looked over at the corner of the room , but there was nothing there . Then he whispered " ice " in a sort of water-logged voice that sounded nothing like him . <p> I went down the hall to the ice machine and came back with a plastic bag full of ice chips . He knew they were letting him die , if not actually speeding things along , but I had an overwhelming urge to say it out loud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injustice over it . <p> I pulled my chair up to his bed and put an ice chip between his lips , where it immediately melted . He must have had some kind of fever . " You know there 's things they can do for you , " I said . " I mean , more than here , anyway . Some bribing would smooth your way out of this . What 's your cash situation ? " I knew he must have some stowed away , since there was practically nothing to buy in the whole country and he had taught a lot of extra courses . <p> The immobility of the skin around his eyes confirmed he 'd already considered and rejected the issue . But at least by broaching the subject , I thought he might tell me what he wanted done with his money . I did n't even know if he had a will . Maybe he wanted it sent to his parents , but considering he had n't even-as far as I knew-told them he was in the hospital , I doubted it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had to acknowledge that his dying was an inevitability now , and not a distant one . We had discussed his family often , but it was always in the context of events that had happened a long time ago . His parents and brother seemed frozen for him , stuck in some year of his early adolescence when their nuclear family had gone bust . I was also afraid that once we started on that conversation , he 'd tell me specifically what to do with his stuff and I would have to lie , pretend that it was all still there . Nod as he went through the whole list of who he wanted to have what-Paul had been envious of his good , heavy-duty American blender , for instance-and not have it show in my face that it was all gone . <p> I put another chip on his tongue . " Maybe you 'll come back as a millionaire , " I said , " and get your Star of Africa . I dreamed it last night . " I meant it as a joke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized I had actually mentioned his death ; I felt terrible . I watched his face carefully to see how he took it . He had definitely heard me . His chest was moving up and down even more laboriously , and his cheeks had a waxy , bloodless sheen like a fake piece of fruit . " Lance ! " I said , a little too sharply . He was scaring me . " Do you want me to get one of those slaggy nurses ? What 's going on , can you breathe ? You 're freaking me out here . " He nodded , but I could almost hear the fluid sloshing in his lungs when he exhaled . " I 'm getting the nurse . " My voice sounded panicky . <p> He shook his head , and moved his arm a little so his palm was facing up , and I held onto it . <p> " I did n't mean it , " I said . " I 'm sorry .. . " Then for some reason , I no longer felt bad about mentioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll see to it you get a sky burial , the real kind , so you 'll be returned to the earth with a leg up on all these other wankers , " I said , trying to smile . I knew perfectly well they would burn his body before it was cold ; I 'd seen them whisking off other people from the AIDS wing , straight to the furnace . But maybe Lance did n't know it-after his first few days there , he 'd only left his room a couple of times . No sky burial , no being gently laid to rest on a mountaintop or a roof , with birds coming to peck your flesh off , and then when only your bones are left , having your loved ones grind them up into bone meal and roll it into little balls and put those out for the birds , too-so piece by piece you 're sort of returned to the air . Just some sullen-faced orderlies with gloves and masks shoving you into a burning tunnel . No , no matter what , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I noticed Lance 's chest was n't going down , it was stuck in an upward , inflated position , but I did n't know how long it had been since it had moved . I had been concentrating on his face , with those blurry unfocused eyes only receiving my gaze and not returning it , trying to gauge how much he understood of what I was saying . <p> I dashed out as quickly as I could without my cane , and when I got a nurse in there I could see immediately she did n't want to touch Lance or do anything to him , and she ran to get a doctor . When she came back with a tiny Indonesian man I 'd often seen bustling up and down the corridors , I grabbed his arm and demanded , " Is he dying , is he dying ? " but of course the doctor did n't know because he had n't looked at him yet . He gently slipped around me and placed his rubber-gloved hands on Lance 's chest , and the nurse turned to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Please leave so we can work , you must get out now , " but I knew she was all bluster , she had no intention of doing anything to help , and even the doctor looked at her rather angrily . Still , there was no place for me right then , so I left , bundled out the door by the harsh one who did n't look strong enough to apply as much force as she did to my arm . <p> I stopped outside the door , now pulled shut behind me , and I could hear banging noises and the two of them speaking Thai . The doctor 's voice was smooth and cold . A woman and a child walked by without looking at me . " Lance , " I said to no one , " I did n't get to finish telling you . . " I kicked the door twice with my good leg , hard . It hurt like hell , but I needed a physical sensation of pain right then . " I think you 'll come back as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . One of those birds that can fly for seven years straight and never have to land on earth the whole time , not once . Would n't that be great ? " I was shouting , but neither the mother nor child , now at the end of the hall , turned around . <p> The same noises were still going on in the room when I left . I went out a rear door , afraid if I saw any of the nurses , I 'd let someone have it . The exit , a barely used one , gave onto a dirty little row of houses . I walked down the street , trying to stay out of the loud traffic of the main road for a few more minutes , grateful for the relative quiet in which to calm down . A jet-black dog lay in the gutter , its eye sockets hollow and its jaw unhinged . As I passed , I could have sworn it moved , made a little wriggle , but it must have been dead at least a week . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took my eye a few seconds to distinguish in the mass of black hair the body of a cat-exactly the same color as the dog , with a thick , healthy black coat-chewing at the corpse , sending a little wave of motion through the dog that made it seem as though its front end were twitching . <p> The farang staff had a little memorial , as though they had cared deeply all along , and several of the Thai teachers who had worked closely with Lance came . Woody , who had started out life as a man but ended up as a woman , was there in three-inch heels , impeccably dressed as all the Thai ladies always were . She cried , taking off her glasses to wipe her eyes and blow her nose , which made me feel guilty because Lance and I used to poke fun at her sometimes just because she was such an easy target , with the name Woody and all . Woody was actually her old name ; as a woman she went by Susi . I think we both secretly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forcing them to let her teach again after her operation , but we never admitted it to each other . She read rather beautifully-where could she have come across it ? -a Wordsworth ode I had n't heard since high school : <p> What though the radiance which was once so bright Be now forever taken from my sight , <p> Though nothing can bring back the hour Of splendor in the grass , of glory in the flower ; <p> We will grieve not , rather find <p> Strength in what remains behind . <p> The other Thais were nodding , trying to pretend they understood a word of it , but it was obvious from the way they sort of snapped to attention when Susi sat back down that the content was a total wash . I wished Lance could have been there , he would have gotten a kick out of catching out those fakers , or at least a smirk . <p> It turned out Lance did have a will , though he had never mentioned it . The Viper told me a few days later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve ourselves lunch , under a tent at the annual end-of-summer departmental picnic . The picnic was held on one of the large , patchy fields on campus , but it was so hot everyone had gathered under the shade of one big tree , like a pride of lions . There was enough food for an army , of course , and the sleek , perfectly dressed faculty were busy gorging themselves . <p> The will had been found when Lance 's desk at school was cleaned out after he 'd died . Even the Viper was n't heartless enough to order it cleaned out beforehand . He had left all his cash-she did n't say how much , but rumor had it the amount was fairly substantial-to an organization that trained prostitutes for vocational jobs-making inlaid bracelets and earrings for tourists , gilding orchids , and so on . <p> I stood off to one side , watching the Viper pat her mouth carefully with a napkin . When she saw me looking , she waved me over . After digging around in her purse , she pulled out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " I donated his teaching materials to our library here . You can have these if you like . " As she passed the envelope into my hand I heard one of the few Thai men in the department , a foppishly handsome fellow with a fake British accent who spoke English even to his fellow countrymen , say to a brand new young teacher , " Yes , sick , you know the sick , terrible , is n't it ? " <p> I took it silently and turned my back on the Viper , opening the envelope as I walked away from the picnic , still in full swing . I 'd had about all I could stand . Inside were all the pictures Lance had had over his desk , most of them of people who were completely unfamiliar to me . I recognized several members of his family . I kept only one-of him and some dog or other , whose paw Lance was holding in his hand , and a very faded newspaper clipping about the Star of Africa , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , mounted in the royal scepter , held under lock and key inside the Tower of London . I dropped everything else into the garbage , hoping the Viper was watching . <p> At the edge of the picnic , I passed a cluster of women who had taken off their shoes and were standing barefoot , their brutally high heels abandoned nearby in the grass . I debated pointing out to the owner of a pair of expensive-looking green pumps that the toddler of one of her colleagues had just removed an enormous hunk of barbecued meat from his bulging cheek and was wringing it out over her shoe . Blissful in her ignorance , she was rubbing one perfectly pedicured foot over the other . But the boy smiled so happily , watching a trickle of gray juice run out of his closed fist and into her shoe , that I decided against it . Life is full of disappointments and rude surprises , I told myself . Let this be just one more . <p> 
##1003641 We were sipping grappa , watching The Tragic Stiletto of Trabzon on an old Zenith TV in a suburban public square outside of Patras . Though it was dusk , and the images were murky , the film looked familiar , like a dim photo resolving in its pan . My wife and I were trying to read the lips of the dubbed and now dead third-rate British movie stars from the forties . An exotic theft held our interest-an amulet pared directly off the heroine 's neck-while soldiers lined the rim of the square to defend the town against any drunk who might raise his fists in a distant recollection of Democratic Greece . It was 1972 , a few years before I 'd start my life over again , but I 'm getting ahead of myself , because it was the words , not even the movie , tragic stiletto , that brought back a hazy memory , a critic over my shoulder , chastising me for something shamefully asinine I 'd once said or done . I could n't remember for sure who 'd said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether I even wanted to remember or to forget . <p> My wife 's handbag , including her passport and traveler 's checks , was lifted off the back of her chair , that 's how distracted we were while locals made faces at us behind our backs : our American dollars were desirable , whereas in the flesh we were banal and expendable , or , as I remembered reading in the paper a few days earlier about a couple in a rented Renault , explodable . We had reason to be distracted . Earlier , we 'd missed the ferry to Brindisi . At least we thought we 'd missed it . Some clerk told us the last boat had departed an hour before . " This time of year we 're very busy , " he said , meaning in the heat of August , " and we sell out tickets fast . " So we bought our non-refundable tickets for the next morning , parked our car at the pier so we 'd be first in line , and sat , until an hour later we saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shout at the swindler , he said , " Oh , I thought you meant our boat . The other has holes . Completely unsafe . " After that , everything else had to be our fault : if there is a country of Omens and Signs , it has to be Greece . <p> In the movie an anonymous dark-skinned swine took a dagger out of some elaborate draping that served as his belt , and , after taking the amulet , stabbed our blond heroine three times , presumably to further the plot so her lover could scour the city and avenge her loss . My wife , I was reasonably certain , had recently slept with someone else , and I kept the hurt close to me , like a cold medallion on my chest , all through Europe . So we sat silently before the screen , until eventually she decided it was stupid to sit in the open air listening to dialogue that sounded like ugly murmurs ( that 's what she thought of Greek ) while the smutty traffic drove back and forth through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lure pretty women in what they saw as their luxurious rusted-out ' 57 Fords . <p> I saw the movie twice . Once as a boy and once as a man . Once while my mother peeled carrots into a pot , cursing at the screen and crying , and once with my wife at my side shaking her head and rolling her eyes . " Did he say Boris or boring ? " <p> " What else would you like to do ? " I asked . <p> " Go to bed " she said , " so we can get an early start for Brindisi . I ca n't wait to get out of this fucking country . " <p> It was still hot , probably still over ninety degrees after six . I was wearing a white oxford shirt and khaki shorts , and they were both saturated with sweat . We had spent the morning on the beach , so our thighs and our shoulders in particular were almost crimson . My wife wore a brown sundress that seemed to have faded after a week in Greece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unexposed skin ; her long brown hair , parted in the middle , was stringy wet . Being in the square , with its cloudy scent of smoked meat wafting out of every window , intensified the feeling of being skewered . My wife 's handbag had been one of those colorful hemp-knit shoulder purses they used to call Greek bags . But now this whole scene is growing too literal , reduced to discussion , so the light around it grows dim . The point is , I tore into her for what she wore around her neck . It looked like a birthmark , but the purple perforated oval had been made by lips and teeth , someone else 's , so I could n't bear to look at her . Besides , everyone else was looking . I was therefore extraneous . <p> My mother came from Russia , was stern in spite of herself ( and hardest on herself ) , and never lost the k-k-k sound to her consonants , and never lost the sea tide lilt to her sentences , so every family in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the height of the Cold War , I 'd heard rumors that she was supposed to have been a spy . A spy who had difficulty getting out of her nightgown until late afternoon . Which must be why the Ruskies lost the Cold War and now run around with cheap imitations of Levi 's , while they mope , jobless , on their street corners . At least that 's what we saw when we went to visit my mother 's homeland without her the week before we took the plane to Greece . " Take pictures of my old house , " she 'd said . Her old house , which was now in another country . Or had been taken down from there so all that remained were tire tracks from a Russian tank . <p> Every Zimmer and Motel we went to refused us a bed for the night , including a place called Zorba 's , which had been recommended in our guidebook as particularly friendly to Americans . So what did we do ? After we left the movie , we walked to the closest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much for a double sleeping bag , a small pup tent ( my wife thought it practical since in Italy we could camp along the coast ) , along with pots and pans and utensils . I even bought a Swiss Army knife , the knife all my friends had owned when I was a boy but my mother had prohibited because she thought it too dangerous . It had a scissors and a corkscrew and a fingernail clipper and a screwdriver . Even at twenty-eight , I thought it astonishing . We walked around for a while with the tent on my backpack , until we found a restaurant whose sign said " Kamping : ' Some of the locals were eating dinner there , and those who bothered to look up to sneer at us made us feel as if we had not been sufficiently humiliated at the movie . " Maybe we 're too old for camping , " she said . <p> " After what we just spent ? " I shrugged . " Look , it 's eight-thirty . You want to sleep in the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The owner was jovial , he called us Mr. and Mrs. America , he still loved Americans , he knew the difference between a country and a government , and then he lowered his voice to say again , " I know the difference between a government and a country , even if I ca n't say so in a normal human voice . So you come here , " he said , and took us to a square gravel of field about fifty yards behind the restaurant . " It 's off-season , " he said , " so you might have the place to yourself . If you need to use the bathroom , it 's right behind my place . " He pointed to what looked like a large outhouse behind the restaurant . " Cold showers , too . " <p> " Off-season , my ass , " my wife said as he left , and I 'm sure he heard us . " Camping in a fucking parking lot . " <p> As we set up the tent in the dark , the foggy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because the hero of the film , for most of it , could n't see three feet in front of his face . And neither could I. I could n't see the other end of the tent in the dark , so I did n't even know if the poles were straight or if my wife was standing by me . <p> You see , earlier in the evening I 'd refused her offering . Just before we sat down to dinner , she 'd taken out of her handbag-so I know she had it then-a small box wrapped in elaborate paper laced with gold thread . " Not now , " I said . I did n't know what it was . " Please , " I said , waving my hands in front of my face . " Not now . I just feel too raw . " <p> I 'd been cruel in the only way I 'd known how , by being distant and indifferent during our whole vacation . We 'd saved up for the past five years to travel , and now I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So you do n't get to really know her , you do n't get to see her close-up , which is not to say she ever admitted she 'd made a mistake , that she had any regrets , that she even knew what she was doing , though I forgot to say she was French , the brightest person in her graduating class at the Sorbonne , she spoke without a trace of an accent , and consequently got taken for an American . I do n't want to tell you how once she loved me deeply , she could n't be happy unless she called me at work once a day , she made me presents out of construction paper and made collages of my favorite movie scenes on video . I held her through nightmares , one of us worked while the other went to school , we wept together when it was impossible to bear a child . You know why I wo n't let you ? Because this is n't a story about love lost . And I refuse to give you metaphors about what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country among enemies who should be friends . Do n't even make me think of what it felt like to slice my finger to the bone with a bread knife the next morning : the shock of ithow long did it last ? -was like an out-of-body experience . And you do n't get to meet any of the people who were nice to us in Greece either . <p> During the movie , I remember now , my mother had cursed the Turks because her own father died in 1916 at their hands in the Dardanelles , but during commercials , my mother offered a long , familiar riff on my father , which she issued with bitterness and rage , though in a soft voice , and with parenthetical apologies , saying she knew that my relationship with him differed from hers , but it was stupid for me to defend him , that I could n't possibly know how he treated her once the bedroom doors were closed , and then she opened her nightgown , exposing one of her breasts , and showed me a thin pink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a slash , I did n't know , and at eleven , I did n't want to ask . " But your father is kind to you , " she said . And when he came home from work , she always wrapped her arms around him tightly , as if she had amnesia , as if she knew , being a mother of the fifties , that she 'd be on the street if she left . " He 's proud of you , as he should be . For that I give him credit . I do n't want to be unfair . " The Russian way she said credit , with the c sound about to deliver phlegm from her throat , I wo n't forget it . So when I think of my mother , I think of spit . <p> The hero-his name , I think , was Frank ( the names were as straightforward as the movies and the age ) -was lost without his love . When he saw couples kissing on the waterfront , he covered his eyes with his hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in those days , every foreign country looked alike-who seemingly wanted to seduce him . There was no one left to trust . And when he saw someone from behind who looked like the thief of Trabzon , his face welled up with that manufactured rage you only find in old third-rate movies , as if the medium had not yet made the successful adjustment from theater , where feelings had to be so visible you could not mistake them : that 's actually what I wanted , as I revisit my mother peeling those carrots ( saying something innocently ugly to me , cursing at the hero ) -why do I feel numb every time her name is mentioned ? -and thinking then about how I 'd let my wife die from me , and how now I had to lie beside her in a tent in a foreign country where we were both , rightly-since we 'd given their dictators guns and dollars to prop them up-despised . <p> Just before I thought of the words The Tragic Stiletto ( earlier and later I mistakenly called it The Magic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the film , after it was completely dark , three junta soldiers armed with American AK-47 's picked up a young man around nineteen or twenty by the shoulders and took him away . It was all done silently , with dignity , and everyone who was n't sitting at that particular table , meaning his mother and girlfriend , acted completely absorbed by the melodrama on the television screen . The young woman tried to follow them , but her way was blocked by another soldier , while the older woman sat at the table holding her head in her hands . My wife-I 'll tell you her name , Justine-actually said , " Should we contact our embassy ? " <p> I looked at her and shook my head . " They 're probably behind it . " So you see what dialogue does , how it takes away more than it supplies , because you ca n't know what it felt like for her to hear that from me , whether she felt stung or relieved or saddened by my cynicism , or whether she was even listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my voice . <p> It took us at least an hour to set up the tent . Justine focused the flashlight on the instructions , and I spread the materials out . The instructions were in French , probably written by Bulgarians . We were missing a pole . I found a stick in the olive orchard that tore a hole in the canvas material . We sighed and cursed . Even with our clothes on the ground as a buffer , the sleeping bags could not soften the hard and bumpy gravel , and I could n't help but think of Hindus sleeping on beds of nails , thinking they were welcome to them . I wished they were Greek . <p> We had some grappa we 'd bought at the department store , and once the tent was up , we sat briefly inside it ( it was too small to stand in ) , cross-legged , and passed the bottle as if it were a peace pipe . " So this is our vacation ; ' I said , looking around the tent . <p> " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's just a mirror image . " <p> " What can we do about it ? " She did n't say , so I continued talking . " You know , I 've been thinking about that guy . " " At the movie ? " <p> I nodded , though I was n't sure she could see my face . " But not him , really . The woman at the table with him , how she wanted to get up to help him , but could n't . " <p> " They just would have thrown her in jail . " <p> " Yeah . But he probably thinks she does n't give a damn . For all he knows , he 's going to rot in jail till the firing squad shoots him . " <p> " That 's melodramatic . Now you 're just projecting . " <p> " Please , Justine , I hate that kind of talk . I 'm just telling you how I felt . " <p> " No you 're not , you 're guessing at what he felt . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her judgment simultaneously with the rightness of it . " I 'm sorry I jumped on you . " Then we were silent for a very long time before I said , " I want to forgive you , but I ca n't . " <p> " Because I 'm unforgivable ? " <p> " Of course not . No one 's unforgivable . " <p> " The junta 's unforgivable : ' <p> " Yeah , " I said laughing , " but you 're not the junta . " <p> " Yeah , but that 's what it feels like ? " I nodded . " I 'm sorry , " she said . " I wish I could say it wo n't happen again . " <p> I wish I could say I asked her why . I wish I could have told her I felt ripped open , not about her sleeping with someone but about everything , not just what was happening to us . But it was n't talk we needed . So I closed my eyes and reached over to feel her hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And then I heard vaguely in the background as I drifted off some accordion music and the clapping of hands , but I was too tired to try to figure out if it came from a dream or not . <p> You can probably guess what I dreamed of . In the movies I might have gotten a telegram that my mother had died , but in fact I was just hovering over her while she cried , asking her again and again , " What 's wrong , why do n't you do something ? " The dream had actually occurred several times in what we call real life , and I 'd often leave our house thinking , She does n't have to be alone if she does n't want to . She 's torturing me . But in the dream , I 'm like an angel , the angel I want to be , as well as the boy sitting beside her watching the movie , telling her I understand , I want to make her feel better , what can I do ? She does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And when she reaches for my hand , she has a ring , or a coin , for me . <p> When I woke up , when I was awakened , it was by a man 's voice murmuring in Greek to a woman , and she was saying something like No , no , but in a tender voice , and it was clear after a while that he was trying to cajole her it was all right , nobody would know , it would feel good , whatever Greek man say in seducing a Greek woman , and behind them I heard loud music coming from the restaurant , but I knew I was n't dreaming . Justine elbowed me and whispered , " How could you sleep through this ? " Then she asked if I 'd get out of the tent and ask them to go away . <p> " What , in Greek ? At least you speak good French . They 'll go away . " And they did , after he apparently pushed her to the ground and gave it to her hard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passionately , Yannis . Justine and I were so ashamed . But as we lay down in our sleeping bags , the rocks pressing against our spines , I 'm thinking I ca n't wait till morning ; but then I hear a number of voices , I do n't know how many , and then I hear one of them laughing and unzipping his pants . I know it 's his pants because a moment later he 's saying , Amerikani , and he 's pissing on the tent , so I have to get up , I have to unzip the tent and stand before them in my underwear , but before I do , I slip into my jeans and feel my Swiss Army knife in my pocket , and I 'm suddenly furious , at Justine and the Greeks and the stupid movie and anybody who 's in my way . Amerikani , I hear , they 're calling to us , laughing , they 're calling me out , and I unzip the tent with my knife flashing , saying , " Bastards , you bastards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back away , but their fists are up , so I move toward them , stabbing the air , I move them toward the restaurant , knowing full well Justine has no passport as I walk away from her , and I lead them toward the bar , which is raucous and crowded , which smells of the tarry scent of Greek liquor and lamb and cigarettes-it all unfolds unbearably slowly like the movie-and I 'm scanning the room to see who it is-what-I have to kill , before I see the owner holding up a shot glass , and spying me doubling over in laughter , wrapping his arms around himself , and then he 's shouting in English , " My hero , my hero , " so there 's nothing else I can do but put the blade between my teeth and act like a pirate or an ape , swinging my arms loosely back and forth , jumping on a table and gesturing wildly until we 're all laughing , until I sit and drink with them and their girlfriends , each of us happily babbling in @ @ @ @ @ 
##1003642 The calm , early-summer afternoon that " in the flash of a moment would be shattered by gunfire " -the newspaper writer expressed it this way-had been unremarkable for the Blakelys : like the other " returning commuters " ( the newspaper writer again ) , they were sitting in traffic , in the heat , with jazz playing on the radio , saying little to each other , staring out . Exactly as it usually was on the ride home from work . Neither of them felt any particular pressure to speak . The music played , and they did not quite hear it . Both were tired , both had been through an arduous day 's work-Michael was an office clerk in the university 's admissions office , and Ivy was a receptionist in the office of the Dean of Arts and Sciences . <p> " Is this all right ? " she said to him , meaning what was on the radio . <p> " Excuse me ? " he said . <p> " This music . I could look for something else . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't mind it . " <p> She sat back and gazed out her window at a car full of young children . All of them seemed to be singing , but she could n't hear their voices . The car in which they were riding moved on ahead a few lengths , and was replaced by the tall side of a truck . Jake Plumbly &; Son , Contractors . <p> " I guess I 'm in the wrong lane again , " he said . <p> " No . They 're stopped , too , now . " <p> He sighed . <p> " Everybody 's stopped again , " she said . <p> They sat there . <p> She brought a magazine out of her purse and paged through it , then set it down on her lap . She looked at her husband , then out at the road . Michael sat with his head back on the seat top , his hands on the bottom curve of the wheel . The music changedsome piano piece which seemed tuneless , for all the notes running up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brushes . <p> She looked at the magazine . Staring at a bright picture of little girls in a grass field , she remembered something unpleasant , and turned the page with an impatient suddenness that made him look over at her . <p> " What ? " he said . <p> She said , " Hmm ? " <p> He shrugged , and stared ahead . <p> No ongoing conflict or source of unrest existed between them . <p> But something was troubling her . It had happened that on a recent occasion a new acquaintance had expressed surprise upon finding out that they had been married only seven months . This person 's embarrassed reaction to the discovery had made Ivy feel weirdly susceptible . She had lain awake that night , hearing her new husband 's helpless snoring , and wondering about things which it was not normally in her temperament to consider . In that unpleasant zone of disturbed silence , she could n't get rid of the sense that her life had been decided for her in some quarter far away from her own small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here in the dark , thinking-though she had done no more and no less than exactly what she wanted to do for many years now . She was thirty-three . She had lived apart from her family for a dozen years , and if Michael were a mistake , she was the responsible party : she had decided everything . <p> Through the long hours of that night , she arrived at this fact over and over , like a kind of resolution , only to have it dissolve into forms of unease that kept her from drifting off to sleep . It seemed to her that he had been less interested in her of late , or could she have imagined this ? It was true enough that she sometimes caught herself wondering if he were not already taking her for granted , or if there were someone else he might be interested in . There was an element of his personality that remained somehow distant , that he actively kept away from her , and from everyone , it seemed . At times , in fact , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unhappy . They got along fine as a couple . Yet on occasion , she had to admit , she caught herself wondering if she made any impression at all on him . When she looked over at him in the insular stillness of his sleep , the thought blew through her that anything might happen . What if he were to leave her ? This made her heart race , and she turned in the bed , trying to put her mind to other things . <p> How utterly strange , to have been thinking about him in that daydreaming way , going over the processes by which she had decided upon him as though this were what she must remember in order to believe the marriage safe , only to discover the fear-it actually went through her like fear-that he might decide to leave her , that she would lose him , that perhaps something in her own behavior would drive him away . <p> In the light of the morning , with the demands of getting herself ready for work , the disturbances of her sleepless hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished to believe . She had been raised to be active , and not to waste time indulging in unhealthy thoughts , and she was not the sort of person whose basic confidence could be undermined by a single bad night , bad as that night was . <p> She had told herself this , and she had gone on with things , and yet the memory of it kept coming to her in surprising ways , like a recurring ache . <p> She had not wanted to think of it here , in the stopped car , with Michael looking stricken , his head lying back , showing the little white place on his neck where a dog had bitten him when he was nine years old . Just now , she needed him to be wrapped in his dignity , posed at an angle that was pleasing to her . <p> She reached over and touched his arm . <p> " What ? " <p> " Nothing . Just patting you . " <p> He lay his head back again . In the next moment she might tell him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirt ( it would cover the little scar ) . She could feel the impulse traveling along her nerves . <p> She looked out the window and reflected that something had tipped over inside her , and she felt almost dizzy . She closed her eyes and opened them again . Abruptly , her mind presented her with an image of herself many years older , the kind of wife who was always hectoring her husband about his clothes , his posture , his speech , his habits , his faltering , real and imagined , always identifying deficiencies . It seemed to her now that wives like that were only trying to draw their husbands out of a reserve that had left them , the wives , marooned . <p> " What 're you thinking ? " she said . <p> He said , " I 'm not thinking . " <p> She sought for something funny or light-hearted to say , but nothing suggested itself . She opened the magazine again . Here were people bathing in a blue pool , under a blue sky . <p> " Wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open for him to see . <p> He glanced over at the picture , then fixed his attention on the road ahead . He was far away , she knew . <p> " Is something wrong ? " she said . <p> " Not a thing , " he told her . <p> Perhaps he was interested in someone else . She rejected the thought as hysterical , and paged through the magazine-all those pictures of handsome , happy , complacently self-secure people . <p> Someone nearby honked his horn . Someone else followed suit ; then there were several . This tumult went on for a few seconds , then subsided . The cars in front inched ahead , and Michael eased up on the brake to let the car idle an increment forward , closing the distance almost immediately . <p> He said , " I read somewhere that they expect it to be worse this week , because the high schools are all letting out for summer . " <p> They stared ahead at the lines of waiting cars , three choked lanes going off to the blinding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had again wandered away from where she was . And she had been thinking about him . This seemed almost spooky to her . She started to ask what he had said , but then decided against it , not wanting really to spend the energy it would take to listen , and experiencing a wave of frustration at the attention she was having to pay to every motion of her own mind . <p> " How could it be worse ? " he said . <p> She made a murmur of agreement , remarking to herself that soon he was going to have to turn the car 's air conditioning off , or the engine might overheat . She looked surreptitiously at the needle on the temperature gauge ; it was already climbing toward the red zone . Perhaps she should say something . <p> But then there was the sudden commotion in the street , perhaps four cars up-some people had gotten out of two of the cars , and were scurrying and fighting , it looked like . It was hard to tell with the blaze of sunlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , almost glad of the change . <p> He had n't seen it yet . He had put his head back on the rest , eyes closed against the brightness . He sat forward , and peered through the blazing space out the window . It was hard to see anything at all . " What ? " he said . <p> She leaned into the curve of the window as if to look under the reflected glare . " Something- " <p> " People are-leaving their cars , " he said . It was as though he had asked a question . <p> " No , look . A fight- " <p> Scuffling shapes moved across the blaze of sunlight , partly obscured by the cars in front . Something flashed , and there was a cracking sound . <p> " Michael ? " <p> " Hey , " he said , holding the wheel . <p> The scuffle came in a rush at them , at the front of the car-a man bleeding badly across the front of a white shirt . He seemed to glance off to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he staggered toward them , and his shirt front came against the window on her side ; it seemed to agitate there for a few terrible seconds , and then it smeared downward , blotting everything out in bright red . She was screaming . She held her hands , with the magazine in them , to her face , and someone was hitting the windshield . There were more cracking sounds . Gunshots . She realized with a spasm of terror that they were gunshots . The door opened on his side , and she thought it was being opened from without . She was lying over on the seat now , in the roar and shout of the trouble , her arms over her head , and it took a moment for her to understand that she was alone . She was alone , and the trouble , whatever it was , had moved off . There were screams and more gunshots , the sound of many people running , horns and sirens . It was all in a distance , now . <p> " Michael , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The frenetic , busy notes of jazz were still coming from the radio , undisturbed and bright , under the sound of her cries . Someone was lifting her , someone 's hands were on her shoulders . She was surprised to find that she still clutched the magazine . She let it drop to the floor of the car , and looked up into a leathery , tanned , middle-aged face , small green eyes . <p> " Are you hit ? " the face said . <p> " I do n't know . What is it , what happened ? Where 's my husband ? " <p> " Can you sit up ? Can you get out of the car ? " <p> " Yes , " she said . " I think so . " <p> He helped her . There were many people standing on the curb , and in the open doors of stopped cars . She heard sirens . Somehow she had barked the skin of her knee . She stood out of the car , and the man supported her on his arm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had some trouble here , " he said . " It 's all over . " <p> " Where 's my husband ? " She looked into the man 's face , and the face was blank . A second later , Michael stepped out of the glare beyond him and stood there , wringing his hands . She looked into his ashen face , and he seemed to want to look away . " Oh , Michael , " she said , reaching for him . <p> The policeman let her go . She put her arms around him and closed her eyes , feeling the solidness of his back , crying . " Michael . Oh . Michael , what happened ? " <p> " It 's okay , " he told her , loud over the sirens . " It 's over . " <p> She turned her head on his shoulder , and saw the knot of people working on the other side of the car . Her window was covered with blood . " Oh , God , " she said . " Oh , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you both , " the policeman said to them . <p> " My God , " Ivy said . " What happened here ? " <p> He had been thinking about flowers , and adultery . <p> One of the older men in the admissions office , Saul Dornby , had sent a dozen roses to his wife , and the wife had called , crying , to say that they had arrived . Michael took the call , because Dornby was out of the office , having lunch with one of the secretaries . Dornby was a man who had a long and complicated history with women , and people had generally assumed that he was having an affair with the secretary . He was always having affairs , and in the past few weeks he had put Michael in the position of fielding his wife 's phone calls . " I know it 's unpleasant for you , and I really do appreciate it . I 'll find some way to make it up to you . It would break Jenny 's heart to think I was having lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how they are . It 's perfectly innocent this time , really . But it 's just better to keep it under wraps , you know , the past being what it is . After all , I met Jenny by playing around on someone else . You get my meaning ? I have n't been married four times for nothing . I mean , I have learned one or two things . " He paused and thought . " Man , I 'll tell you , Jenny was something in those first days I was with her . You know what I mean ? " Michael indicated that he knew . " Well , sure , son . You 're fresh married . Of course you know . Maybe that 's my trouble-I just need it to be fresh like that all the time . You think ? " <p> Dornby was also the sort of man who liked to parade his sense of superior experience before the young men around him . He behaved as though it were apparent that he was the envy of others . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mistake of being initially in awe of him . But though Michael now resented the other man and was mostly bored by his talk , he had found that there was something alluring about the wife , had come to look forward to talking with her , hearing her soft , sad , melodious voice over the telephone . Something about possession of this intimate knowledge of her marriage made her all the more lovely to contemplate , and over the past few weeks he had been thinking about her in the nights . <p> Sitting behind the wheel with the sun in his eyes and his wife at his side paging through the magazine , he had slipped toward sleep , thinking about all this , thinking drowsily about the attraction he felt for Dornby 's wife , when something in the static calm around him began to change . Had his wife spoken to him ? <p> And then everything went terrifyingly awry . <p> He could n't say exactly when he had opened the door and dropped out of the car . The urge to leave it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smearing down the window on his wife 's side . He had simply found himself out on the pavement , had felt the rough surface on his knees and the palms of his hands , and he had scrabbled between stopped cars and running people to the sidewalk . It had been just flight , trying to keep out of the line of fire , all reflex , and he had found himself clinging to a light pole , on his knees , while the shouts continued , and the crowd surged beyond him and on . He saw a man sitting in the doorway of a cafeteria , his face in his folded arms . There were men running in the opposite direction of the rushing crowd , and then he saw a man being subdued by several others , perhaps fifty feet away on the corner . He held on to the light pole , and realized he was crying , like a little boy . Several women were watching him from the entrance of another store , and he straightened , got to his feet , stepped uncertainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was mostly quiet now . Though there were sirens coming from the distance , growing nearer . The gunshots had stopped ; and the screams . People had gathered near his car , and Ivy stepped out of the confusion there , saying his name . <p> He experienced a sudden rush of aversion . <p> There was something almost cartoonish about the pallor of her face , and he could n't bring himself to settle his eyes on her . As she walked into his arms , he took a breath and tried to keep from screaming , and then he heard himself telling her it was all right , it was over . <p> But of course it was n't over . <p> The police wanted statements from everyone , and the names and addresses . This was something that was going to go on , Michael knew . They were going to look at it from every angle , this traffic altercation that had ended in violence , and caused one man to be wounded in the abdomen and another to be shot in the hip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . " This one 's in the hip , " one of them said , and another answered , " Abdomen here . " It was difficult to tell who was involved and who was bystander . The traffic had backed up for blocks , and people were coming out of the buildings lining the street . <p> There was a slow interval of a kind of deep concentration , a stillness , while the police and the paramedics worked . The ambulances took the wounded men away , and a little while later the police cars began to pull out , too . The Blakelys sat in the back of one of the squad cars , while a polite officer asked them questions . The officer had questioned ten or eleven others , he told them-as though they had not been standing around waiting during this procedure-and now he explained in his quiet , considerate baritone voice that he needed everybody 's best recollection of the events . He hoped they understood . <p> " I do n't really know what was said , or what happened , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightest idea , okay ? Like I said , we did n't know anything was happening until we heard the gunshots " <p> " We saw the scuffling " Ivy said . " Remember ? " <p> " I just need to get the sequence of events down , " the officer said . <p> " We saw the scuffle , " said Ivy . " Or I saw it . I was reading this magazine- " <p> " Look , it was a fight , " Michael broke in . " Have n't you got enough from all these other people ? We did n't know what was happening . " <p> " Well , sir-after you realized there was gunfire , what did you do ? " <p> Michael held back , glanced at his wife , and waited . <p> She seemed surprised for a second . " Oh . I-I got down on the front seat of the car . I had a magazine I was reading , and I put it up to my face , like-like this . " She pantomimed putting the magazine to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . " <p> " And you ? " the policeman said to Michael . <p> " I do n't even remember . " <p> " You got out of the car , " said his wife , in the tone of someone who had made a discovery . " You-you left me there . " <p> " I thought you were with me , " he said . <p> The policeman , a young man with deep-socketed eyes and a toothy white smile , closed his clipboard and said , " Well , you never know where anybody is at such a time , everything gets so confused . " <p> Ivy stared at her husband . " No , but you left me there . Where were you going , anyway ? " <p> " I thought you were with me , " he said . <p> " You did n't look back to see if I was ? " <p> He could n't answer her . <p> The policeman was staring at first one , and then the other , and seemed about to break out laughing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very considerate . " It 's a hard thing to know where everybody was when there 's trouble like this , or what anybody had in mind . " <p> Neither Michael nor his wife answered him . <p> " Well , " he went on . " I guess I 've got all I need . " <p> " Will anyone die ? " Ivy asked him . <p> He smiled . " I think they got things under control . " <p> " Then no one 's going to die . " <p> " I do n't think so . They got some help pretty quick , you knowMr . Vance , over there , is a doctor , and he stepped right in and started working on them . Small caliber pistols in both cases , thank God-looks like everybody 's gon na make it fine . " <p> Michael felt abruptly nauseous and dizzy . The officer was looking at him . <p> " Can you have someone wash the blood off our car ? " Ivy asked . <p> " Oh , Jesus , " Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look a little green around the gills , sir . You could be in a little shock . Wait here . " He got out of the car , closed the door , and walked over to where a group of officers and a couple of paramedics were standing , on the other side of the street . In the foreground , another officer was directing traffic . Michael stared out at this man , and felt as though there was n't any breathable air . He searched for a way to open his window . His wife sat very still at his side , staring at her hands . <p> " Stop sighing like that , " she said suddenly . " You 're safe . " <p> " You heard the officer , " he told her . " I could be in shock . I ca n't breathe . " <p> " You 're panting . " <p> In the silence which followed , a kind of whimper escaped from the bottom of his throat . <p> " Oh , my God ; " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the officer coming back , and she noted the perfect crease of his uniform slacks . Her husband was a shade to her left , breathing . <p> " Ivy ? " he said . <p> The officer opened the door and leaned in . " Doctor 'll give you a look , " he said , across her , to Michael . <p> " I 'm okay , " Michael said . <p> " Well , " said the officer . " Ca n't hurt . " <p> They got out , and he made sure of their address . He said he had someone washing the blood from their car . Michael seemed to lean into him , and Ivy walked away from them , out into the street . The policeman there told her to wait . People were still crowding along the sidewalk on that side , and a woman sat on the curb , crying , being tended to by two others . The sun was still bright ; it shone in the dark hair of the crying woman . Ivy made her way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the polite officer was helping Michael across . The two men moved to the knot of paramedics , and the doctor who had been the man of the hour took Michael by the arms and looked into his face . The doctor was rugged-looking , with thick , wiry brown hair , heavy , square features , and big , rough-looking hands-a man who did outdoor things , and was calm , in charge , perhaps five years older than Michael , though he seemed almost parental with him . He got Michael to sit down , then lie down , and he elevated his legs . Michael lay in the middle of the sidewalk , with a crate of oranges under his legs , which someone had brought from the deli , a few feet away . Ivy walked over there and waited with the others , hearing the muttered questions bystanders asked-was this one of the victims ? <p> The doctor knelt down and asked Michael how he felt . <p> " Silly , " Michael said . <p> " Well . You got excited . It 's nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get up now ? " <p> " Think you can ? " <p> " Yes , sir . " <p> The doctor helped him stand . A little smattering of approving sounds went through the crowd . Michael turned in a small circle , and located his wife . He looked directly at her , and then looked away . She saw this , and waited where she was . He was talking to the doctor , nodding . Then he came toward her , head down , like a little boy , she thought , a little boy ashamed of himself . <p> " Let 's go , " he said . <p> They walked down the street , to where the car had been moved . Someone had washed the blood from it , though she could still see traces of it in the aluminum trim along the door . She got in , and waited for him to make his way around to the driver 's side . When he got in , she arranged herself , smoothing her dress down , not looking at him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic . It was still slow going , three lanes moving fitfully toward the bridge . They were several blocks down the street before he spoke . <p> " Doctor said I had mild shock . " <p> " I saw . " <p> They reached the bridge , and then they were stopped there , with a view of the water , and the rest of the city ranged along the river 's edge-a massive , uneven shave of buildings with flame in every window , beyond the sparkle of the water . The sun seemed to be pouring into the car . <p> He reached over and turned the air conditioning off . " We 'll overheat , " he said . <p> " Can you leave it on a minute ? " she asked . <p> He rolled his window down . " We 'll overheat . " <p> She reached over and put it on , then leaned into it . The air was cool , blowing on her face , and she closed her eyes . She had chosen too easily , when she chose him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it arrived ; she gave in to it , accepted it , with a small bitter rush of elation and anger . The flow of cool air on her face stopped . He had turned it off . <p> " I just thought I 'd run it for a minute , " she said . <p> He turned it on again . She leaned forward , took a breath , then turned it off . " That 's good . " She imagined herself going on with her life , making other choices ; she was relieved to be alive , and she felt exhilarated . The verv air seemed sweeter . She saw herself alone , or with someone else , some friend to whom she might tell the funny story of her young husband running off and leaving her to her fate in the middle of a gun battle . <p> But in the next instant , the horror of it reached through her , and made her shudder , deep . " God , " she murmured . <p> He said nothing . The traffic moved a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idled forward , then accelerated slowly . <p> " Mind the radio ? " she said . <p> He thought she seemed slightly different with him now , almost superior . He remembered how it felt to be lying in the middle of the sidewalk with the orange crate under his legs . When he spoke , he tried to seem neutral . " Pardon me ? " <p> " I asked if you mind the radio . " <p> " Up to you , " he said . <p> " Well , what do you want ? " <p> " Radio 's fine . " <p> She turned it on . She could n't help the feeling that this was toying with him , a kind of needling . Yet it was a pleasant feeling . The news was on ; they listened for a time . <p> It 's too early , I guess , " she said . <p> " Too early for what ? " <p> " I thought it might be on the news . " She waited a moment . The traffic was moving ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , and sat there with the air fanning her face , eyes closed . She felt him watching her , and she had begun to feel guilty-even cruel . They had , after all , both been frightened out of their wits . He was her husband , whom she loved . " Let me know if you think I ought to turn it off again . " <p> " I said we 'd overheat , " he said . <p> She only glanced at him . " We 're moving now . It 's okay if we 're moving , right ? " Then she closed her eyes and faced into the cool rush of air . <p> He looked at her , sitting there with her eyes closed , basking in the coolness as if nothing at all had happened . He wanted to tell her about Saul Dornby 's wife . He tried to frame the words into a sentence that might make her wonder what his part in all that might be-but the thing sounded foolish to him : Saul , at work , makes me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around on her . I 've been going to sleep at night dreaming about what it might be like if I got to know her a little better . <p> " If it 's going to cause us to overheat , I 'll turn it off , " she said . <p> He said nothing . <p> Well , he could pout if he wanted to . He was the one who had run away and left her to whatever might happen . She thought again how it was that someone might have shot into the car while she cringed there , alone . " Do you want me to turn it off ? " she said . <p> " Leave it be , " he told her . <p> They were quiet , then , all the way home . She gazed out the front , at the white lines coming at them and at them . He drove slowly , and tried to think of something to say to her , something to explain everything in some plausible way . <p> She noticed that there was still some blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seeped down between the door and the glass . When he pulled into the drive in front of the house , she waited for him to get out , then slid across the seat and got out behind him . <p> " They did n't get all the blood , " she said . <p> " Jesus . " He went up the walk toward the front door . <p> " I 'm not going to clean it , " she said . <p> " I 'll take it to the car wash : ' <p> He had some trouble with the key to the door . He cursed under his breath , and finally got it to work . They walked through the living room to their bedroom , where she got out of her clothes , and was startled to find that some blood had gotten on the arm of her blouse . <p> " Look at this , " she said . She held it out for him to see . <p> " I see . " <p> The expression on her face , that cocky little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppressed the urge , and went about changing his own clothes . He was appalled at the depth of his anger . " Can you believe it ? " she said . <p> " Please , " he said . " I 'd like to forget the whole thing . " <p> " I know , but look . " <p> " I see it . What do you want me to do with it ? " <p> " Okay , " she said . " I just thought it was something-that it got inside the window somehow . It got on my arm . " <p> " Get it out of her , " ' he said . " Put it away . " <p> She went into the bathroom and threw the blouse into the trash . Then she washed her face and hands , and got out of her skirt , her stockings . " I 'm going to take a shower , " she called to him . He did n't answer , so she went to the entrance of the living room , where she found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she asked . <p> " Is what on ? " <p> " Okay . I 'm going to take a shower . " <p> " Ivy ; ' he said . <p> She waited . She kept her face as impassive as possible . <p> " I 'm really sorry . I did think you were with me , that we were running together , you know . " <p> It occurred to her that if she allowed him to , he would turn this into the way he remembered things , and he would come to believe it was so . She could give this to him , simply by accepting his explanation of it all . In the same instant something hot rose up in her heart , and she said , " But you did n't look back to see where I was . " She said this evenly , almost cheerfully . <p> " Because I thought you were there . Right behind me . Do n't you see ? " <p> The pain in his voice was oddly far from making her feel sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though . And you would n't have known it . " <p> He said nothing . He had the thought that this would be something she might hold over him , and for an instant he felt the anger again , wanted to make some motion toward her , something to shake her , as he had been shaken . " Look , " he said . <p> She smiled . " What ? " <p> " Everything happened so fast . " <p> " You looked so funny , lying on the sidewalk with that crate of oranges under your legs . You know what it said on the side ? ' Fresh from Sunny Florida . ' Think of it . I mean nobody got killed , so it 's funny . Right ? " <p> " Jesus Christ , " he said . <p> " Michael . It 's over . We 're safe . We 'll laugh about it eventually , you 'll see . " <p> And there was nothing he could say . He sat down and stared at the television , the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lawrence , Kansas . She walked over and kissed him on the top of his head . <p> " Silly , " she said . <p> He turned to watch her go back down the hall , and a moment later he could hear the shower running . He turned the television off , and made his way back to the entrance of the bathroom . The door was ajar . Peering in , he saw the vague shape of her through the light curtain . He stood there , one hand gripping the door , the rage working in him . He watched the shape move . <p> She was thinking that it was not she who had run away ; that there was no reason for him to be angry with her , or disappointed in her . Clearly , if he was unhappy , he was unhappy with himself . She could not be blamed for that . And how fascinating it was that when she thought of her earlier doubts , they seemed faraway and small , like the evanescent worries of some distant other self , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she looked along her slender arms , and admired the smooth contours of the bone and sinew there . It was so good to be alive . The heat was wonderful on the small muscles of her back . She was reasonably certain that she had dealt with her own disappointment and upset , had simply insisted on the truth . And he could do whatever he wanted , finally , because she was already putting the whole unpleasant business behind her . <p> 
##1003643 THERE ARE ON INRING ( SO GI told me ) a few small areas that have been built up . My destination point was not , however , one . <p> We spent the morning setting up the imported artwork ( 2417-Y ) in the vaurine library at the far end of the station complex : in the course of it , I began to get some feel for just how primitive the little world I 'd come to was . <p> Have you ever spent time ( a few months , say ) somewhere in love with reflection ? Where the streets , the walls , the windows , the transportation machines and disposal gondolas all have polished surfaces on which , right or distorted , your own image glides past you wherever you pass ? And have you , from there , gone on to a place where all objects are wholly without gloss ? In your first hours or days at your matte location , you find that the multiplicity and iteration of image you 'd learned to live with somehow had become more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an extent only fully felt once you moved along alleys and avenues whose stone and mottled plastics gave you nothing back , their opacity having cut out all cursory repetition ( of you or anything else ) at a root , that lies , to your astonishment and even pain , not between yourself and the world , but within that model of the world within you which is all you ever know of it ; and you learn something of your limitations as a woman . <p> There 's a similar amputation , diminishment , and constraint ( and insight ) when you go from a place where all is mentally activated illusion to one with a more material surface . <p> Certainly , in that Inring compound beside the landing field , there was adequate GI : ask a question , and it was answered , briefly and quickly , by a burry voice projected into the back of your mind . But there were not the attendant projections of memories , associations , and suggestional supplements that attended the larger GI systems you find in extensive urban complexes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were quite enough mentally activatable switches . When you stood in front of a door and thought , " Aperture-7 , " the door openedthough , on your third trip through , you realized that the smudges on the white oval , just below chin-height , were not some carefully modulated design in subtle , smeary grays , but were rather the trace of many , many women before you who 'd pushed it open by hand . <p> When you went into a dark room and thought " Glow-4 , " the strip lights came on all across the ceiling of the octagonal chamber-though , after a moment , you realized that the single white panel in the far corner that remained dark and the other one near it that now and again flickered were not a refreshing asymmetry incorporated in the arrangement of the illumination elements : they were broken . <p> And when you stood in the twenty-meter beige cradle connecting the major and minor office complexes and looked across the benches out that huge transparent canopy curving up and arching back overhead , you knew that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a near-empty night , were exactly what was there . ( There 'd been no planoforming , not even a seeding of elephant lichen on this sector of Inring . ) And there were no numbers or words or colors or smells in any codic combination you could think of to change it . <p> At last , with many comings and goings , 2417-Y was gotten into its tiny chamber , whose real space was perhaps three by three by three meters , but which , when you got permission from the compound librarian and entered its red doorway , put you into hundred-meter marbled halls , towering columned arcades , and sky-lit gardens of glass rods , a-flitter with smoke and light , a-clatter with harsh music , a structure almost as extensive and ornate as Dyethshome back on Velm-though conceived in a ( much greater number of ) vastly different style(s) . But helping set it up in the vaurine projector with my new employer , that morning ( the kind of thing an Industrial Diplomat may be called on to do if the destination point is backward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it the set of lip and slightly narrowed eye we humans display on almost any world when disappointed . <p> Why ? Well , I could only guess . <p> But one of the biggest factors in the human response to any artwork is what you happened to have been doing , thinking , feeling , and the place you 'd been doing , thinking , and feeling it in , just before you encountered it . Art makes its entire effect by developing things from your landscape , denying other things in it , and replacing still others with the artists ' vision : that means the same text must be read differently on each different world , because you bring to it the experiences of the different landscape against which the artifact is constantly engaged in argument . And despite the little I knew of it , I could say for certain that Krome 's landscape ( and 2417-Y 's origin ) was not Inring 's . And though my employer , thought she remembered 2417-Y from her adolescence light-years away , what she really recalled was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entangled in-Krome . But whether 2417-Y would prove to be a rich and decentering and/or stabilizing experience here , or simply become a vastly expensive irrelevance off in a little room , visited less and less frequently , till the projector was shut down and the importation costs ( and my fee ) were written off , I could not tell ; nor , indeed , could my employer , -at least not till she 'd shaken that memory loose . For it was only as 2417-Y was absorbed by ( as her disappointment had begun that absorption and transformation of ) Inring 's ' scape could anyone , here , understand anything of 2417-Y , even unto its alien history on another world . <p> " You do n't look comfortable , " my employer , said , when , once we were through , she had strolled back with me to the cradle . She herself wore at least fifteen pounds of metal medallions at knees , elbows , and waist , as well as light plastic tubing about her neck , thighs , and armpits : glimmering rings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees . Her beard , which had been red in the morning , was now ( after an hour each of blue , yellow , and green ) black . " It 's pretty rough out here . We get a lot of folks from all parts of the planet passing through . They do n't like it either . " She frowned . " Not many from off world , though . " <p> " I 'm comfortable , " I said . " In fact I like it here . Actually , I was thinking of staying . " <p> " Nobody else would , " she said , sadly . " Folks come by from over in Qwik-you can tell them because they 're all hung around with those silver furs and big blocky whachamacallits on their elbows . We always say : Take something off ! Relax ! ' Then the ones from down in Litimis , they come up here and just stride on through with nothing on at all . You 're always sitting around and saying to them , You sure you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'll feel more at home . ' " She sighed . <p> At my neck I closed another fastening on what they still , there , actually called a space suit . Down in the bulky boots were these loops you were supposed to slip your toes through ; in the right one , it had gone fine . In the left , however , two of my middle toes had missed ; or the loops were broken ; or something . And I was kind of wiggling my foot around to try and find out what exactly it was , and what I might do about it , and not making much headway . <p> And that 's the kind of thing a primitive GI is no help with at all . <p> " I think that 2417-Y , " my employer , said , " is the most important thing that 's ever happened on Inring . Certainly it 's the most important thing that 's ever happened on this part of it . It 's about the only piece of real culture we 've got . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking , of life , here at the complex . Do n't you agree ? " <p> I pulled down the head guard , whose airtight clasps went clitter-click , clitter-click , clitter-click , all around my neck . " You may be right , " I said , not sure if my external speaker was on or not . Then I nodded at her with whatever smile I could mechanically muster and started toward the bronze circle , the bottom half of which was in the beige wall , the top half in the clear canopy . <p> I clopped toward the energy sheet that , like rippling water over glass , served as the cradle 's airlock . <p> Though I 'd worked with her for most of Inring 's very nonstandard day , handing things , holding things , pointing and prodding with her , I realized I had n't even bothered to notice her hands-which for me was once about as automatic as the click-curses constantly expostulated , in both laughter and rage , among the shale-farmers of the equatorial zones of Celluv IX or the leisurely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all among the polar butane workers of Hatatki VII . <p> As the night wavered a moment in my eyes , and sparks struck silently from my hip and head as I went through the shield , I realized again that I was a repository of a vast womanly experience of cultural relativity ( so much vaster than man 's could ever be-which was the way we humans once characterized ourselves when we 'd been confined largely to a single world ) , from the hundreds of worlds I had visited in my job , ( and among the thousands more I had not visited , or even , perhaps , heard named ) : yet that relativity was precisely what I 'd come here to lose , to leave behind , to forget . I wanted only something simple , absolute , monumentally unshifting , and still . <p> I stepped over the threshold , onto the outside terrace , leaving the artificial gravity for the far less intense " down " of the natural world . I swayed under those few distantly spaced stars . We were well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost since the beginning of colonizing , put us extremely far away from anywhere . ( The cluttered night above those worlds lost in the hub is equally a sign that one is far away from anyplace else , on the edge of the unknown : most of our exploration and colonization has been along the mid-arms . But that was not where I was ; and again I tried to shake out of mind that urge that always made me see everywhere in terms of somewhere else . ) I made my way forward , aware , as I strode over the dusty flags , that a few rocks had been kicked or thrown or even , presumably , set there by others suited against the near-vacuum as bulkily as I. <p> I moved forward , a woman in a dusty , airless ' scape where woman was just not meant to go . <p> To my left were towering , blobbed filigrees of the space ships that , as usual this far out , followed some design either so alien or so primitive I had n't seen it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountainous black nebula we were quite close to ( eight light-years ? ) cut out even the few stars that should have been visible in that direction , joining the land with night . <p> Those small , cold worlds are notoriously empty of visual variety ; nor had I bothered to learn what little that variety might mean about the structure of the planetary ball I waddled over , so that the no-color between brown and gray , lit largely by my shoulder lights and the haze from the station complex behind me , was as void of information for me as a landscape could be . <p> I walked through it , refusing to think about myself or it . <p> I walked a long time . <p> After perhaps forty minutes , or an hour-forty minutes , I stopped . <p> A rock slab had freed itself from the dust , to rise , over the next twenty feet , perhaps a meter ; as I reached its edge I realized this was the best this world could do toward a crag . <p> I looked up into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only see out of your eye 's corner . <p> Then I shouted : " Rat Korga . .. ! " In the tiny helmet space , the sound hurt my ears . I shouted again : " Korga . . . ! " And again : " Rat . . . ! " <p> And : " Rat Korga ! " I reeled on rock as his name filled up my ears , my mouth , my eyes , along with the perpetual stutterings from my speaker , the burblings from my air regulator . " Korga ! Rat Korga ! " I looked up at a darkness that might as well have been a ceiling ten feet overhead , though it was made up of thousands on thousands of light-years of nothing . " Korga ! Rat ... ! " <p> I shouted and shouted . I tore my throat and battered my ears . In that air globe where his name roared no farther away from my face than a few thicknesses of my hand , on that nightbound rock hardly heavy enough to warrant the word world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blackness that would show no wonder from its presence , no horror at its absence-that hung , vast and ignorant , before each iteration my raw tongue rasped from under a burning pallet , as though each shriek were my first vocable . <p> For moments darkness about me was an infirm ear bent toward me ; to each scream the universe mumbled , Pardon . . . ? What was that . . . ? I did n't quite catch you . . . ? Come again ? , while for the fortieth , fortyseventh , and fiftieth time I shouted , shaking , at night . <p> For a while I stopped . <p> Then I shouted some more . <p> I was sitting , now , on the stone , leaning on one thick mitten . My throat was too sore to go on . So I just muttered it , hoarsely , as though his name were the access code that , repeated enough , would change the universe , would make this most marginal rock a center of labor , art , and community . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Rat . . . ! " <p> I could n't tell you how far away the light was . But it wobbled and drew closer ; and grew bigger . <p> " . . . Korga , " which came with no voice at all , a movement of muscle and bone in my chest and jaw , making no sound in the soundless dark . <p> At first I did n't look . Then , because here and there in it were such bright lights , I could n't look . <p> It came toward me . There was someone inside it . Her vacuum suit was far more compact and streamlined than mine . Her shoulder-plates glimmered ; rings of lights around her calves blinked . My own lights reflected in her face plate . <p> For whatever reason , any number of Web officials might have chosen just then to look me up : Halleck , Fenz , Marta , Japril , Sarena , Ynn .... Any number of Inring locals I 'd met in the course of delivering and setting up 2417-Y might have decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jovial library assistant of that morning 's installation , to my employer1 herself , or even that fellow debarkee with whom I had brief and listless sex shortly after I 'd landed earlier in Inring 's long , long day and who I 'd thought had gone off afterward to other geosectors . <p> The figure climbed the rock . Her face plate cleared of glare . I frowned . " You are not . . . " ( It was a painful whisper. ) " . . . whom I expected to see . " I took a breath . " Here . " <p> " Ah , Skynosh Marq , but I did expect to see you . Here . Well , one takes what one can get , " JoBonnot said . " But then , I have been looking for you . While you have not been looking for me . Is n't that right ? Very logical , yes ? " She looked up at blackness , around at darkness . " You have really managed to get quite far away . One would almost think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But then , as I was following you , I heard your call , over my earphones . " Behind the plate she scowled , and one hand went up to rub at where her ear would have been on the head mask . " Very loud . As if you were calling , perhaps , for something-someone . Some Rat Korga . And yet " -she scowled harder , looking around once more- " I do not think here , by any means , is the most reasonable place to find her . " <p> " JoBonnot , " I said , " lust is not logical . " <p> " Lust is what you have , " she said . " Love is what you want . Ah , the intricacies of desire ! " <p> " I do n't know how you got here , " I said . " I do n't know why you 've come . But right now , I only know what I do n't want . And I do n't want anything to do with life . " <p> " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't want to die , " I said . " I just do n't want to live . " <p> Inside her mask , JoBonnot looked at me strangely . She reached toward me . " That is dreadful , " she said . Her hand came toward , and did not quite touch , mine-like my little white sister , light-years away . <p> I took another breath . <p> The effort was painful . <p> Not only to my throat . <p> " Dreadful , " she repeated . " But we can change all that . Yes ? " She spoke bluntly , brightly . " That 's all you have to say . " <p> There on the dark rock I shook my head . <p> " That 's no in one language , yes in another , " she commented . <p> " JoBonnot , no .... " <p> " Yes , ' she said , like some childhood Cil instruction series , correcting a wrong answer . " Marq Dyeth , what do you know of the Xlv ? " <p> I looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , briskly . " In some ways , you have picked a very good place to come . We 're well outside Web security . Ah , yes , I can see that you 've heard of them before-the X1v . But then , we 've mentioned them within each other 's hearing , have n't we : I to you . You to me . Back home . At your home . On Velm . " <p> " I know the Xlv are something the Web says I 'm not supposed to know about-an alien race with interstellar travel that woman has not yet established true communication with . And I know the Xlv in their mysterious ships were circling Rhyonon when Korga 's world was destroyed . . . you said they were circling mine when he was taken away . " <p> " You never struck me as a woman who liked to be told what she could or could n't know , Marq Dyeth . " <p> " I hate it , " I said ; and began to cry . <p> " Left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JoBonnot said , " do you think you can go on hating ? " <p> " I . . . " Searching out energy even for that , I felt I 'd expended the last of it in my futile howl against night . " I do n't know , JoBonnot . " I went on crying . " I do n't . . . know anything anymore . " <p> " I can give you Rat Korga back . I can give you two a world of your own-if you will help me save mine . It only takes a little hate . " <p> I frowned . <p> " I can give you information . Tell me again what you know of the X1v . And Rhyonon . Tell me about the Xlv and your own home world of Velm . " <p> " I know ... well , someone told me .. . " My throat ached . My eyes stung . " I mean , when Rat 's world went into what may or may not have been Cultural Fugue and destroyed itself , Xlv ships were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred and sixty of them ; or three hundred and sixty thousand-I 'm not sure which . Below them , the first fireball started . . " I blinked . " And someone-you , JoBonnot-told me that when the Web took Rat away from my home , away from Velm , away from me , again there were many Xlv ships circling my world . Circling Velm . And when he left , in the Web shuttle , you said they left ..... <p> " And that seems like meaningful information , does n't it ? " JoBonnot nodded . " It suggests all sorts of correlations , alignments , possibilities . Oh , yes ! A little knowledge ? Often a very , very , very dangerous thing . We human-style women have known that since before we left our own world , wherever that was . Well , listen to me , Marq Dyeth . I have something more to tell . See what it does to that information you feel , now , you are just on the brink of possessing-the constellation of facts that the Web , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more of . Look . Listen . Attend carefully : so far you know what the Web wants you to know . Now I will tell you some of the things they do n't want you to know at all . Oh , how clever of you to come out here beyond Web security . One would almost think we had it planned . Well , no matter . Listen to me now , Skynit Marq . It is true , three weeks before Rhyonon was destroyed , three hundred sixty thousand X1v ships gathered in a cloud about Rhyonon and began to circle it ; and approximately two standard , twenty-four hour days after the holocaust was over , they left it . But for the last twenty-nine years fleets of Xlv ships of comparable size , some slightly larger , some indeed notably smaller , have been gathering at Rhyonon approximately every other month standard , to circle the planet for a little over three weeks , before leaving . And the time they stay has always been the same . Also , consider this : in the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have continued to gather there , circle it , and leave- " <p> " But . . . but what are they doing ? " I asked . " Are they just observing ? Does that mean that they did n't have anything to do with the holocaust ? " <p> " Consider this also , Marq Dyeth . As far as Velm is concerned , there has been similar behavior from Xlv ships for almost eighty-nine years standard now : many fewer ships in that case-only a hundred and seven thousand . They stay perhaps seven standard weeks , then leave for between eight and nine . The pattern has been quite consistent for getting on to a century now . Now I bet you did n't know that , Snu Marq . " <p> " But why mv world ? Why Rat 's ? " <p> " Oh , and there are still other pieces of information that must be considered before we get to that question : of the six thousand inhabited worlds in the Web 's range and jurisdiction , " JoBonnot went on , " there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been noted . For at least six of these worlds , there is indication that this periodic visitation , circling , and leaving has been going on for well over two standard centuries . But those six include neither Velm nor Rhyonon . " <p> " And how many of those hundred and two worlds have gone into Cultural Fugue and wiped themselves out ? " I asked . <p> " One , " JoBonnot said . " Rhyonon . " <p> " Then , you mean , the Xlv were just observing : and they were n't really responsible for what happened on . . . ? " <p> " Do not overread the data I gave you : that is as bad as underreading what you 've already read . Consider this too : the Web has logged over four thousand other worlds , uninhabited and uninhabitable by humans ( and most of the alien species we 've made contact with ) , which are also the object of these periodic visitations by the Xlv . One notes it 's a number of the same order of magnitude as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one barren planet where the number of X1v ships reported to converge is slightly above eight hundred thousand and the period itself is eight hours there , and fifteen hours away ; and it goes on constantly . I hear it 's quite spectacular-though no human has witnessed it . " <p> I frowned : " Then we do n't even know if what they 're interested in on the human worlds is even the human moDulation or not ! " <p> " Are their visitations a form of art ? Theology ? Scientific research ? A biological necessity ? A cultural jape ? Are they all there , circling their myriad worlds , for a single purpose ? Or are there as many different explanations as there are Xlv ships , or Xlv aboard them ? " JoBonnot shrugged . " The X1v are alien . We do not know their language ; or languages ; or even if they have a language . We can not communicate with them . They have not communicated with us . We can not know them-and can only guess at what , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not overread . " She reached out toward me again . ( I raised my bulbous mitten , think to push her away . ) " But do not underread either . Would you like to see a Xlv , Skina Marq ? " <p> My frown , never free of my face , fell apart in complete bewilderment , as though the fragments might wash off with my tears , and I saw a fluttering in the dark behind her , as indistinct as , minutes ago , JoBonnot herself had been . A flicker : and what fluttered beneath , glimmered . It drifted forward , climbing the rock as she had climbed it , though it was certainly not human . I blinked , trying to judge its size , which is hard when you 're looking at something you 've never seen before . It was membranous , hulking , liquefacious , and-I think-blue . Lights hovered in a constellation over it . As one part bobbled and lolloped forward and another flowed and flapped behind , I thought : any one of those movements , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , suspicion , or any number of alien stances no human could know . The lights circled above her , part , doubtless , of whatever forcefield allowed her to move and maintain shape over this unpressured ' scape . <p> " But what . . ? " I pushed back . " I mean , is she really a . . . ? " <p> " Oh , I 'd say , rather , he " -and JoBonnot adjusted her squat on the rock " is my dear , dear friend- " <p> Suddenly I stood , staggering with the surprise of delayed recognition . " But that 's not a Xlv ! " I rasped . " That 's a native of Nepiy ! Your home world ! I 've seen one of her before , JoBonnot ! " The alien began to recede into the dark , the lights above her dimming . " I 've talked with women of her race before ! I 've even worked for one ! That 's no Xlv , JoBonnot ! How did you get here ? And why did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surely you must have encountered the custom somewhere before . Besides , I merely asked if you wanted to see a X1v . I did n't say I 'd show you one . Here . Now . On this particular bit of barely habitable stone . I brought him because , well , Clym and I . . . " She paused . " I have a job , for you , Skynum Dyeth . Will you take it ? " JoBonnot looked up at me , her forearms over her knees . Now she reached up . " Come home with me , Marq Dyeth . Come with us . " Her thin fingers , in their entirely different kind of vacuum protection , seized my great glove . " Come with us to my homeworld of Nepiy . I need you-we need you . Do this for me , for us , for Nepiy ; if you do , there we will give you back your Rat . " She stood , now , before me ; and , in her grip , I reeled . " Come home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meters overhead . A row of lights marched off into darkness , their little glow here and there lighting bronzish rocks . We sat among columns strung with vines and great metal petalsalien sculptures of giant flowers . <p> Whatever we sat on was desperately uncomfortable-like my own contour chair stalled eternally before its flex . <p> Off in the distant dark came the faintest flicker of blue . <p> Silence pulsed for three , four breaths . <p> Then thunder , nearly dumb in its deeply muted growl . I said : " I 've seen the lightning , grown blood red , whip and shatter the overhead fumes of Nepiy . " <p> " Ah , " said JoBonnot . " Most likely you were much farther south-closer to the equator . " <p> " Very filmy caves " -I frowned at the columns around us , the lights beyond us- " Golden veils on the humans , as if they imitated the native women 's blue and rippling demeanor . At least that 's how I remember it . " <p> " You must have been , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ translator pole- " a third of the way-certainly more than a fourth-around to the east . Not the west , definitely . The east . " <p> Again thunder rose , but only to the deepest hum-before it fell to silence . <p> I said : " When I was on Nepiy before , fumes and lightning tore up the overhead gases and the land outside the powershields was rife with some catastrophe that threatened starvation for three whole urban complexes . Although this is only a simplified account , it had to do with the failure of a crop of beans . Almost all the women I talked to were afraid it might be Cultural Fugue . " <p> " The Quintian Geosector Grouping . " JoBonnot tapped her fingertips together . <p> " One of the smaller , if not the smallest of the Quintians. " 9-K drifted back till her pole was decidedly off-center . " Definitely the smallest of the Quintians . Would n't you say ? " <p> JoBonnot nodded . " There are women all over Nepiy afraid of Cultural Fugue . Even here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its silence . JoBonnot looked as uncomfortable on her seat as I felt on mine . " Of course the situation around here is substantially worse than in the Quintians . " <p> Once I looked at the blackness , listened to the silence , wondering what signs of what tragedies were sunk within them that I could not read . <p> " Of course this cassette does not show them , " JoBonnot said , as if realizing my thoughts . " It was recorded at a happier time . " She shifted . " Still , the Thants " -standing , her features become almost indistinguishable by her column- " have been called to Nepiy by Family sympathizers to be the Focus Unit for our world . " <p> " I know that , " I said . " My nurture stream on Velm has entertained the Thants back home , at Dyethshome , at Morgre . Many times . " <p> " Wo n't do , " said the blobby blue woman , drawing in around her translation pole . ( I had asked the ship 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nepiy natives do n't use them at home , but I had been given a number I could refer to her by if I wanted : 9-K . But through some vestigial diplomatic sense it just did n't feel right . ) Somewhere above the vegetative webbing between the poles ' knobby heads , thunder rumbled again in that rippling sable . " Just wo n't do . Human , all too human-you see ? You understand , Marq Dyeth ? Can you apprehend the problems of a woman such as I ? " <p> " Like Velm , " I said , squirming on something not quite stool , hassock , chair , or couch , " Nepiy has both an alien population and a human population , living largely in peace with one another . I learned that from my single visit to your world , back when I learned some of your Nepiyan fellows were worried about a possible Cultural Fugue condition . " <p> " Like Velm , " JoBonnot said , from her column , " it is more complicated than that . " <p> Burbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unlike Velm , Marq Dyeth , Nepiy has both ggggg and nnnn . " The two buzzes were on only slightly different pitches . <p> I frowned . " Ggggg and nnnn , " JoBonnot repeated . " The two terms are so common among the Nepiy they have entered our human language . " <p> " I do n't think I heard them when I was here-I mean there , on Nepiy . Of course I was only getting the most simplified of accounts . " <p> " It would have to have been a very simplified account , very simplified indeed , " 9-K declared . " Myself , my translator has n't been able to deal with ' beans ' at all . Beans ? Beans , you say ? " <p> " Neither , apparently , could the women of the Smaller Quintians . They 're not native to your world , " and while I wondered if I should mention that these particular beans had come from mine , 9-K saved me the diplomatic embarrassment : <p> " Ah ! " She bulged forward again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get on with it . Go on , now . Go on . " <p> " Ggggg are Nepiy 's highland plateaus . And nnnn are the lowland ribbons that wind between them , across much of the surface of our world . This cassette here " -JoBonnot gestured around us- " is set up to represent a rather romanticized section of nnnn . The lowlands . The cloud layer , up there , covers most or even all of the nnnn : often vast storms , vast rains , and always vast darkness . " <p> " Yes , I remember it from my visit . " <p> " Climb up the rocky slope , there , and you will break through the broiling mists and emerge , at last , on some ggggg rim . " <p> " We women of Nepiy , " said the alien , through her pole , " have always lived along the bottom of the nnnn , underneath the clouds . Why , you ask , Marq Dyeth ? What are our reasons ? What is the functional answer in terms you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it simply ; it involves chemistry , psychology , evolution-which , you understand , are normally concepts as alien to us as vfvfvfvfdk , rrrrmmmh , and gktqbtk are to you . " ( That 's the best I can do with the humming buzzes she uttered : and since they came from her pole , that meant they were already translations . ) " But we have lives there ; we live there ; and we want to go on living . " <p> " Up on the ggggg , " JoBonnot said , " only humans live . They have their urban complexes , their society , their industry . But the humans who do , tend to-how shall I say-forget that any other women share their planet with them . There is fear of Cultural Fugue-that terrible social condition in which worlds destroy themselves-from the depths of the nnnn to the centers of the most isolated ggggg . And it is very much the tension between ggggg and nnnn that is involved . The humans of the ggggg , at the urging of the Family , have decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultural play . " <p> " On my single visit to Nepiy , " I said , " the area I visited was certainly deep within a crisis . And in the lowlands . . . in the nnnn , I saw of the fear of Cultural Fugue . But women anywhere fighting real and pressing chaos tend to fear that , first thing . I 've seen it on many worlds , JoBonnot-worlds that still swing quite whole and neatly in their orbits about the night . And on Nepiy there were no official Web parameters to suggest your world was heading anywhere near CF. " <p> " Worlds are big places , Marq Dyeth , " said blue bubbly 9-K . " You could not have seen all of Nepiy . In the period you were there , you could only have gotten the most simplified picture . " <p> " A Focus Unit must reflect and focus the concerns of a world , " JoBonnot said . " Consider , then , a world with two racial species , who imports a Focus Unit consisting only of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " I gather it 's rather moot just how much stabilizing a Focus Unit can do , anyway-but then , I was brought up under the Sygn , and we tend to look down on all traditional Family techniques . Do you mean to bring in the Sygn to help right the situation ? Certainly on worlds where the women are divided between native and human , their dogma seems more geared to easing tensions and promoting peaceful coexistence . " <p> " Once you are on a world , if the conflict between Family and Sygn becomes too heated , especially as the various precepts are taken up by hostile institutions with other names , it can lead a world even closer to Cultural Fugue , rather than resolve the turmoil . " <p> I smiled . " That 's true . " At least it 's certainly what one hears as one slides along vague and variegated strands of the Web . " Yet there must always be some tension between them , if either is to avoid becoming the basis of some oppressive regime . And since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seeing a conflict in one local place that may , indeed , look huge , tend to give it more importance in world terms than it deserves . I 'm a woman who has been to many worlds , JoBonnot . " <p> " And I , " said the blue woman , puckering about her pole , " am a woman who has suffered very deeply on my own , Marq Dyeth . " To which , I 'm afraid , there 's not much you can say . I said : <p> " You 've decided , then , that you 're not bringing in the Sygn . . . ? " " What we would like to bring to Nepiy , Marq Dyeth , is you . And your Rat-oh , not for good ! Only for the briefest of visits ! " JoBonnot shifted about , looking suddenly as uncomfortable on her seat as I felt on mine . " We do n't want to make you our Focus Unit . We do n't want any Focus Unit at all . But among the range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marq Dyeth . So is Rat Korga . The two of you are especially interesting to women who are frightened of Cultural Fugue . " <p> " Because Rat 's world was destroyed by Cultural Fugue ? " I asked . " Or what may- " " -or may not- " " -have been Cultural Fugue ? " I finished . " Interesting , " 9-K hummed . " Especially to women who fear it . " <p> " The ambiguity simply sounds the note of anxiety which makes the fascination even richer , more resonant . Oh , it 's very interesting , the relation between you two . And to so many decimal places- " " Look , I- " <p> " When a Focus Unit takes over on a world , it must be made an occasion of great interest , " 9-K burbled . " Great publicity ! Vast amounts of information and misinformation , shuttled about the world ! Public relations ! Promotion ! Hype and hyperbole ! I imagine it can be quite interesting . " <p> " So we are going to bring you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And there we will join you with the Rat . " " And you 're hoping the . . ' interest ' we generate will upset the campaign to . . . to establish the Thants in their new position ? " But the possibility , even as I spoke , was already hammering my heart hard enough to hurt my throat . <p> Thunder rumbled . The blue woman came completely to pieces , splashed away in several directions over the rocks , then splashed back again to congeal about the pole . " Oh , she understands ! She understands it ! Ah , you were so right . She is , indeed , a very interesting woman ! " <p> " Only I do n't know if I want to be all that interesting- " <p> " Do you want Rat Korga ? " JoBonnot asked . <p> I looked up at the clouds sealing off the rocks and gorges around us in this cassetted nnnn . " Yes . " And the lightning flashed : but , within those broiling darknesses , it was red and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going back to ship normal for a while . " I stood up on the shaley ground . <p> " As you wish , Sketu Dyeth , " JoBonnot said , looking triumphant . <p> 
##1003644 This story I wrote while I was an undergraduate at the University of Michigan , probably in 1960 , although I liked it enough to submit it ( unsuccessfully ) after I moved to New York in 1962 . The twenty-year-old writer was already seeking to find a symbol for his confused sexual identity in his version of the hermaphrodite-a double-natured but far from self-sufficient being . <p> HILARY 'S PARENTS , in their quiet , reasonable way , had decided to present their child to the world as a boy . There were so many advantages to being considered a male-the independence , the dignity . Mr. and Mrs. Quarles , who were both from substantial backgrounds and who had spent their lives in the New England academic community , could only foresee for their son an existence quite like their own . And , as they knew , scholars would take more seriously papers written by Mister rather than Miss Hilary Quarles . University gentlemen got along well with a manner that was soberly sexless . And so , after the unexpected consultation at the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stationery store and bought the blue birth announcements . Years afterward , when Hilary was living by himself in Chicago , he pictured that conference in the maternity ward with some bitterness . How busy they had been in their " adjustment " to his " condition . " He had compiled a list of their euphemisms for his dubious gender . In their sweet and evasively cerebral manner , they acted as though there were no physical reality , but only some sort of curious psychic predisposition underlying the awkward references they made to him . Hilary wanted nothing to do with them . He had spent too many springs assisting his mother in the greenhouse . On too many afternoons he had played recorder duets with his aunt . For God knows how many times he had sat in the family box at the theater , only to be gently ushered out once the play was over down the deserted stage exit to the waiting car . When he was twenty-one he left home . He slammed the door behind him as decisively as he could . Because , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that he was more man and more woman than both of them put together . They had consoled their pride by thinking , How natural it is that our bloodlines have finally pooled into a vague , glistening pond of imperceptible animality . Hell ! He was an animal-the animal par excellence . Hilary 's closeted upbringing had prepared him only for chamber music . If one has been acquainted solely with the domestic fluting of Mother and Father and Tutor and Aunt , then the gazoo of Chicago bars dazes . People laughed or people were obscenely curious . Hilary would n't put up with it . He had his pride . It was , of course , a highly constructed , ironical brand of pride . Nonetheless , he could see nothing good about sitting around public places and being treated like a freak . He knew he was a freak , but he also knew that there were more subtle , interesting ways of approaching freakishness than making fun of it . After hearing these few strains of rock and roll , Hilary once again confined himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spacious , expensive apartment on the Near North Side and began to decorate it the way he liked it . He read books and sipped wine . And grew restless . Decorating his home was his only distraction . Chicago was going to be his home . It was just far enough away from New England and his parents " protective concern . More importantly , it fitted his temperament , or rather temperaments . Chicagoans had n't quite made up their minds about themselves , and neither had he . His neighbors on the Gold Coast were rehearsing their wealth , their manner , their loves . The performance was neither a tryout nor a first night ; it was more like a dress rehearsal . In this nervous and not quite perfected play there was still a chance for him . Not that Hilary had made any sort of a sociological study of the subject . Actually he did n't know anyone in the entire city . All the data he needed to support his conclusions were drawn from his snobbishness-and his hopes . Choosing a single piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tortured dialectic . His first impulse was to select something tastefulan unadorned drop-leaf table , Persian rugs , a muted blue batik bedspread . But that was just what his parents would have . Then , go ahead , buy that big TV on the plastic wheels , and that gold putto . Hang it over your toilet . Do your bedroom in scarlets and purples and be a whore , white and puffy : play the overweight odalisque . However , he would lose his nerve and end up by buying anonymous Danish pieces and wall-to-wall beige carpet . A skilled eye could have discerned his personality in the completed decor only through working back from the compromises . Hilary had never expected too much . He had wanted his independence and now he had it . From the beginning he had not listened to his parents " twaddle . A lot they knew . When his aunt or his mother had found some new subtle level of perception in him , or some previously undiscovered talent , he had always possessed enough sense to dismiss their well-worded praise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had led the life of the mind , savored the perfume of his moods , catalogued his thoughts . He soon found out he was n't their sort of thinker . Perceptions and talents were far from first best . The first best could be seen in the cartilaginous stretchings of the cat on the stair-steps . Black fur picking up the blue tints from the cut-glass windows , white teeth yawning over the ridged recesses of the mouth , purring and licking and lazy independence . Hilary was more man and more woman than both his parents put together . He had never expected too much . One time he had taken the family car on a summer night-summer was torture for him-and gone to a drive-in . Guiltily he had stolen glances at the teen-age boy and girl in the car next to him . He had watched the lovers on the screen before him . His hands , big and soft , had wandered over his own body . He had cried . He did n't cry now . There was something too obvious , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents , as a matter of fact-would expect him to cry . They would probably be disappointed if he did n't . Well , he would enjoy disappointing them by regarding himself as just as self-sufficient as-do n't halt before the unpalatable-a snail . Very clever , very recondite , and very unhelpful . Because the snail image was n't right . Unfortunately he was a worm , monecious surely , but in need of another worm . And the worm idea collapsed , too . Because he did n't want another worm ; he wanted a man or a woman . Sometimes it disconcerted him that he thought of himself so baldly-that he surveyed his own anatomy so relentlessly . What would his aunt think , in her flat-chested , shiny , pleated blue dress ? Or his mother and father who slept in separate beds ? Oh , he was quite conscious of women 's chests , and men 's , too , and sleeping arrangements between men and women . . . . It would be better if he could follow the effete family tradition , if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking uplifting and highly diffuse thoughts . When he was honest he admitted that his mind was diffuse-endlessly busy , as a matter of fact . Yet for what purpose ? Not to lead the life of the mind , but rather ceaselessly to meditate upon the permutations of sex . Hilary met Will . Will was a hillbilly who worked in the all-night diner three blocks away . He was quite efficient , and seemed to take great delight in saying to someone who had stopped in only once or twice before , " You take that rare , do n't you , sir ? " Will was cheerful , an " asshole for betting " as he chose to describe himself ; he would lay any bet at any odds on anything from the Rose Bowl to pinochle . He wore a thick gold wedding band . Light red hair bristled at his neck above his T-shirt . He addressed everyone as " sir " or " miss , " except adolescent boys whom he called " son . " He was familiar but respectful with Hilary . Hilary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Will . When just the three of them were in the diner , the two cronies would curse and spit , and Will would throw glances at Hilary which half apologized and half included him . In all his life Hilary had never been included in man 's talk . Will called him " Sir . " Sometimes Hilary and Will were alone . Hilary could n't help admiring Will 's white-aproned form , the apron wrapped tightly around his body . They would talk occasionally ; Hilary sounded to his own ears disinterested and formal . During the first month the subjects of their conversations were the weather , the customer who just left , or sports . Hilary bought all the Chicago papers now and avidly read the sports columns ; at dinner-time he listened to some sports commentator on the radio . Predictably enough , as he mastered the male vocabulary and the male topics , something yielding and seductive within him blossomed . Even as he kept his voice in its lowest register , solemnly forecast the results of tomorrow 's game , and nudged at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his woman 's desires sang . Hilary could n't stop going into the diner every night , but he only chatted with Will on Tuesdays and Thursdays . He had to limit himself , or else Will would become bored or suspicious or revolted . One Saturday afternoon Will came over to Hilary 's apartment to drink beer and watch the game on TV . It had taken half of Hilary 's strength to make the invitation and the rest to keep from baking cupcakes and pouring tea . The visit was quite uneventful , but Hilary analyzed Will 's every smile and sought to find its cause . They started attending sporting events on Saturday afternoons . Hilary always paid and Will did n't object . After a while Hilary found convenient and unembarrassing ways to slip Will some money every week . Will never probed but neither did he resist Hilary 's probings . Hilary began to confide . And Will 's powers of understanding were remarkably sensitive ; he was smart , though ignorant , and knew when to reply and when not . Hilary had a buddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If Hilary had had no money , Will would n't have given him the time of day . Furthermore , as Hilary unexpectedly discovered one day , Will knew the score . Before they went to the game one Saturday Hilary had , with characteristic perversity , shed the bulky suit coat he usually wore and stood before his buddy , the shirt pulled revealingly across his breasts . Will did n't blink . Once , when Will said he was awfully short on money , Hilary had asked him if he would sleep with him . And Will had drawn close , really not so intelligent , really not so handsome , put his hands on Hilary 's shoulders and said gently but definitively , " No . " There was no hope in all the world . There was no psychoanalyst , no religion that could make Hilary a man or a woman . Hilary put on a record of Gabrielli , rested his head on Will 's lap-Will , the stupid but undeniable man , would permit Hilary Quarles that much and no more-and cried . Grotesque as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still had the nerve to use Will 's valuable time and make him hear the sound of sobs issuing from the snail . 
##1003645 By the time he was thirty-eight Neil Benka had given up on domestic happiness . He had twice been married and twice divorced . <p> " I do n't mean anything to you , " his first wife had sobbed , shortly before she left . " No one does . " " You are an icicle ! " his second had summed up on her way out . " Why do n't you go down to Antarctica and medicate the penguins ! " How mistaken they were , both of them . Genevieve ( the first ) and Callie ( the second ) meant a great deal to Neil . He 'd loved the way Genevieve kept his desk adorned with daisies during the four exhausting years of medical school . She 'd buy the flowers on her way home from her saleswoman 's job . In Genevieve 's presence his normal irritability decreased . He had told her so . <p> She 'd looked up at him from under her mischievous lashes . Her fingers stroked the two vertical lines that already creased his young but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a rare , sensual smile . But it was his eyes that made those women who noticed him in the first place take further notice : eyes dark gray yet translucent , like a winter pond . He blinked every so often , in a slight irregular tic . His tic did not catch their consciousness-they were n't aware of it as a tic-but it engaged their hearts , to their subsequent regret . <p> " Less irritable with me ? " Genevieve had wondered . " Not so 's anyone would notice . " She was playful no longer ; this was a cry from the heart , perhaps somewhat self-justifying , since she was already engaged in the affair that would lead to her second , happy marriage . Who could blame her ? She was a soft and affectionate person , not meant to be wasted on a man with a perpetual scowl . But he had admired her even while he scowled . As for the redheaded Callie , who ran herself ragged on behalf of her impoverished clients , he admired her too . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despaired of his craving to be alone . " I suppose you feel superior to us plodding public-interest lawyers , " she stormed . " You 're so intolerant , Neil . " <p> Intolerant ? Yes . But his was not an intolerance of faults . What he could n't tolerate was not people 's deficiencies . What he could n't tolerate was people . What he could n't tolerate was their presence in the room . In the company of other humans his skin itched and the inside of his nose prickled . <p> He 'd had these symptoms since adolescence . The various specialists he had consulted during college could find no source for them . A neurologist who worked him up during medical school offered him nothing but a psychiatric referral . The psychiatrist listened for a few sessions and then prescribed anti-anxiety medication . The pills made Neil 's mouth dry but did nothing to reduce either the itch or the sniffle . He threw the vial away . He was n't anxious , after all . He was n't even anti-social . He was merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or with a grain of sand always under the eyelid . <p> His ex-wives thought he should have remained a bachelor ( in Callie 's opinion he should have become a monk ) . Within medical circles , where ogres abound , he was considered to have a tolerable personality and a talent for diagnosis . Sometimes he thought of devoting himself to research , immuring himself in a lab ; but the ruinous fact was that , although they made him sick , he liked people . He was n't an icicle . He missed Genevieve and Callie . He missed patients who had died . <p> So he stopped expecting happiness . After the divorce from Callie he threw himself even more actively into his work . But there was always some woman in his life . The women were of the two types epitomized by Genevieve and Callie : there were the unambitious , tranquil ones , and the lively , adventurous ones . From the first type he wanted emollient-why could n't they soothe him ? From the second he sought homeopathy-small curative doses of poison . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> One woman strummed the lute as a hobby . She introduced him to the early-music scene . He learned to play the recorder , though he never played well . But in the process he became a frequent concertgoer ; and he contributed money to various Renaissance groups and Baroque chamber orchestras ; and he got invited to their parties . At one party he met Irene . <p> She was no social butterfly . Entering a room shook what poise she had . A mere " What 's new with you ? " made her eyebrows leap up into her scalp . But she was a dedicated luthier-she made , by hand , stringed instruments in the baroque style-and every so often some grateful customer insisted that she be present at a concert and at the reception following . And so " Hello , " said Neil . " Hello . " <p> Her palm was damp . They chatted for a while . He sensed the frenzied activity of her heart . They talked some more . He saw that she noticed his tic . He offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed . <p> Her lofty studio was pleasantly disordered . There were books in English and French-she had studied her craft abroad . Completed instruments hung on the walls . Woodshavings littered the floor and sawdust hung in the air ; anyone with reactive mucous membranes should have been sneezing up a storm . But Neil was breathing freely . <p> He watched Irene hunt among her cupboards for a bottle-any bottle . " I had one once , " she muttered . <p> " Tea would be fine . " She put a kettle on her little stove . She had fair untidy hair and a long nose and green eyes and a soft mouth . She was as tall as he , and very slender . <p> She poured the tea . He cut a lemon into wedges , and added rum to each cup from the bottle she had finally unearthed . He felt her eyes on him . His skin did not crawl . " Your head would make a good tete sculpt &e,"; she said . " What 's a tete sculptee ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gamba . Above its neck . " Holding their tea they walked across the studio to the hanging instruments . " That 's a simple volute , " she said , pointing to a carved scroll . " That 's a traditional cherub . " Her cup was rattling on its saucer . <p> " And a lion here , very well done . And a young girl there . " Her cup grew calm . She spoke in a low firm voice . " I 'd like to make a carving of you . Perhaps you would n't mind posing . Or I could work from a photograph . " " You flatter me . " " I do n't know how to flatter . " <p> He looked at her . He saw a tense , uncheerful , and unwitty young woman who , because she loved her work , had just mastered her customary terror and asked for his head . He felt like handing it over ; and handing himself-such as he was-too . Neglect might be the very thing she craved . And perhaps , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would develop a tolerance . <p> Even a taste . <p> Neil and Irene have been married for thirteen years . They have a twelve-year-old daughter , Michal . Her abnormality is clearsightedness . She realizes that her parents are afflicted . In public Neil sniffs and scratches ; or , frowning , tries not to sniff and scratch . But he has recently adopted a pipe , and his mouth settling around the stem looks less disagreeable than formerly . Irene 's brow has become a tracery of arabesques . At home , though , her voice hardly quivers at all . <p> Michal figures that one day somebody will name , isolate , and cure her parents ' peculiar maladies . Meanwhile they are attentive to her needs and interested in her progress without being at all demanding ; she has an easier time of it , she 's noticed , than do most of her friends , children of ordinary folks . <p> 
##1003646 Dateline-Well , I do n't quite know . Some kind of parking lot , I suppose , but other than that , nothing is certain . My guess is about twenty miles north of Greenwood , Mississippi . Maybe Tallahatchie County . Maybe still Leflore . <p> That date is Wednesday , December 16 , the first day of the official duck hunting season according to the Mississippi Department of Game and Wildlife . I 'm less certain of the time . It 's still too dark to read my watch . <p> My assignment is to go on a duck hunt , then write about it for the benefit of the general public . Or at least for the readers of the Delta Sentinel . The paper , more specifically its publisher , J.V. Emerson , is my employer , has been for close to four months . <p> " Capture the sights and sounds , " J.V. told me yesterday , throwing a paternal arm around my shoulder . " The sights and sounds of a real Mississippi Delta Duck Hunt . And the smells , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a loss for the smells , since my nose is stuffed up . As for the sights , it 's too dark to see much of anything , except for two bright yellow headlight beams , which cut through the black night air in clean , sharp strokes . So I must rely right now upon the sounds . Fortunately , I have a tape recorder , heavy , black , plastic , sitting on my knees . But at this moment , the whirring of its motor is about the only substantial sound I can hear . <p> I am in the back seat of Mike Frazier 's Ford Bronco . The seats are covered with a plush velour . The heat is on full blast ; it fills the car with warm air and a soft , soothing hum . It is very cold outside , colder than I thought it could be in the South . <p> My hosts , Mike Frazier and Kenny Dunlap , picked me up at my apartment at ten after four . A.M. <p> I am wearing thermal underwear , top and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of socks , a thick wool shirt , and camouflage : pants , parka , and cap . All of these are borrowed from Jack Hendricks , the sports editor at the Sentinel . When I asked him for them yesterday afternoon , he was quick to oblige . " I sure wish I could go with you , " he sighed , " but the wife wo n't put up with it no more since we have little Cal . I sure do love duck huntin ' though . Ai n't no place I 'd rather be on a winter 's morning . " I laughed . I thought he was kidding . He was n't . <p> The only thing that is mine are the boots . L.L. Bean 's Maine Hunting Shoes , insulated . I 've had them for almost four years . When I bought them , they were very much in style on campus . I was a freshman . I never dreamt I would actually use them for their officially designated purpose . <p> I 'll be sure to keep that stuff about my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managing editor , will say it has no place in the story . <p> Still , I will have to describe what my hosts , the real hunters , are wearing . It is the exact same outfit as mine . I was relieved when I first realized this . I thought Jack was playing a joke on me when he gave me the camouflage gear . <p> " I 'm glad you dressed right , " Kenny Dunlap says as I climb into the truck . " Mike here forgot to tell you about the camouflage . " " Well , I figured the boy knew , " answers Mike Frazier , spitting a few crumbs into his thick brown beard . He is eating a sausage biscuit . He has graciously offered to share them with me , but the hour and the cold have made me nauseous . <p> " And how would he know a thing like that ? " <p> " Hell , I do n't know . Do n't they have hunting up in Yankeeland , David ? " <p> " They do , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Of course you 've never been , " Kenny Dunlap says . He smiles . <p> " You have better things to do with your time , I should hope . " <p> " I ca n't imagine what that would be , " Mike Frazier counters . He twists his thick neck so he can look at me , but his face only makes it far enough to point his right eye in my direction . " Son , you 're gon ' have the time of your life today . There is nothing more exciting than pulling a green-head right out of the sky . " <p> " Well then , I do n't know why you did n't tell him about the camouflage , " says Kenny Dunlap . " Unless , that is , you were counting on your charm luring them into the boat . " He turns back to face me . He is more successful at it ; I can see both of his eyes . <p> " You see , David , ducks are a lot smarter than ol ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see a human being sitting in the middle of a swamp from a mile up . Hell , to them , we stick out like a flashlight in the dark . If you 're not camouflaged a duck will see you , no matter where you hide . And if they see you , there 's no way in hell they 're going to get anywhere near your hole . It does n't matter if you 've got the sexiest decoys in the Delta and the sweetest call . Ducks are n't stupid . That 's the fun of hunting . You do n't just walk up to ducks and shoot them . You have to outsmart them . " Mike Frazier and Kenny Dunlap love hunting even more than Jack does . Mike Frazier is the president of the Leflore County Chapter of Ducks United . Kenny Dunlap is the president of the Carroll County Chapter . Ducks United is a national wildlife preservation organization . Their goal is to cultivate summer duck habitats in Canada so that the ducks can survive until winter , when they migrate down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ducks United , shoot at them . <p> A couple of months back , Warren had me write a feature on the organization . Mike Frazier liked it so much that he called the paper to invite me to go hunting with him on the first day of the season . I was out when he called . Warren took the message . He thought it was a grand idea for a story , and he accepted for me in my absence . He did n't tell me about it until last week . <p> " When are we going to go out in the boat ? " I ask . <p> " Now , do n't be in too much of a rush , son , " says Mike Frazier . <p> " As soon as we get out of this truck you 're gon ' want to get right back in it . " He 's right . I have forgotten how cold it is outside . " Besides , " adds Kenny Dunlap , " we ca n't go out into the swamp until a quarter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here at " I look at my watch , a futile effort " what time is it , anyway ? " <p> " A quarter to five , " Kenny Dunlap says . His watch , a hunter 's model , glows in the dark . " As for your first question , I 'm afraid I do n't have a logical response . " " Who else do you see here ? " Mike Frazier asks me . " Nobody . " From where I sit , this dirt parking lot for the swamp ' s launch area looks like the emptiest spot on earth . " Exactly , " he says , grinning . <p> " You see , David , " says Kenny Dunlap , " whoever comes first gets their pick of the holes . " The holes , he has already explained , are tiny inlets , barely big enough for one boat . What makes a hole a hole is the presence of trees , which hide the boat from the sky . " So some holes are better than others ? " " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why get here an hour early ? Are n't there enough holes for everyone ? " " Plenty , " says Mike Frazier . " But we get here so we know we 're the first . You just wait . About five , ten minutes maybe 'll come up this ugly , light-blue piece of shit Chevy pickup . That 's Hughie Foster and Jerry James . They 're cousins . Well , five-no , now it 's six years ago , they beat me and Kenny here , and I 'll be damned if we ai n't beat them every year since , and God help me the year they get here before we do . Last year , Kenny and me got here 9:30 the night before the first day . After that , they pretty well gave up . " <p> I laugh , but Mike Frazier is dead serious . I wiggle my left foot inside the boot and it hits something hard . A steel pipe . In real life , Mike Frazier owns a plumbing and irrigation company in Greenwood . Kenny Dunlap owns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of Carroll County . They both make good money ; Mike Frazier 's truck has everything including heated seats and three shotgun racks , each holding a polished 12-gauge , with glossy wooden stocks and shiny black barrels : I can tell they are expensive . So is the boat , a low-bottomed metal affair on a trailer . The boat is also camouflaged . Mike Frazier has already backed the trailer into the water ; he will get his pick of the holes , no doubt about it . Sure enough , a few minutes later a pair of headlights turns into the lot . Mike Frazier flashes his highbeams twice , then leaves them on . In their light , I can see that the other set belongs to the anticipated light-blue Chevy pickup . It is a huge truck , the kind with four doors , six seats , eight rear tires , and a payload as big as a wading pool . It too pulls a trailer , atop which sits a boat that is easily twice as deep as Mike Frazier 's , and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a look at that damn yacht he 's got hisself , " Mike Frazier says . " We gon ' have to start callin ' ol ' Hughie Commodore . " <p> The other truck pulls to a stop about twenty feet in front of us . Both doors open at once , and two figures step out of the cab . " Well , I guess there 's no avoidin ' it anymore , " Mike Frazier says . " C'm on , Kenny , let 's go . " As they open their doors , two sharp slashes of air attack me from either direction . Mike Frazier turns around . " Come along , son , " he says . " You don ' want to miss the best part now , do you ? " <p> Four beams of light cut neat paths through the black night air . They all come together to form a bright yellow circle in between the trucks , and everyone steps into this area . <p> The two men from the other truck look a lot like my hosts : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is camouflaged . But the bearded man in the other party is thin like Kenny Dunlap , and the clean shaven one is about as fat as Mike Frazier . They look like two sets of twins , although I ca n't quite tell who is related to whom . " Well , Hughie , " Mike Frazier says , shooting his eyes back and forth between his wristwatch and the big beardless man standing on the driver 's side of the Blazer . " You 're early this year . Quail season do n't start for another six weeks . " " Shit , Mike . You been here since last winter ? " " Just about , " says Kenny Dunlap . <p> " I done tol ' you , now , Hughie , " says Mike Frazier . " I done tol ' you six years ago , and I ' 11 tell you now , you ai n't never gon ' beat me out here . When I die , I 'm gon ' have my children haul my cold dead carcass out here before yours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't give a damn for shootin ' no ducks . Hell , I think I 'll just go out to my hole-which , by the way , is the only good hole in the whole damn swamp-and take me a nap . " <p> " Well , I 'm sure the ducks 'll be relieved about that , Mike , " the new man answers . " Even the sound of you fartin ' in your sleep is sweeter than that pitiful excuse for a call you blow . Hell , you remember that day last year I shot the limit in less'n an hour ? I had three green-heads come down and just beg me to put them out of their misery . Came right into the boat . ' Course , I 'm sure they woulda gone into your tub if they were n't afraid of drowning . " " Jesus , Jerry , how do you put up with this bag a wind ? " <p> The thin bearded man shrugs and tips his head to one side . " Well , Jerry , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sufferin ' bastard at that , let me introduce you to David Green . " <p> The thin bearded man reaches out and shakes my hand . His grip is weak ; I can barely feel it through both our gloves . " Pleasure , " he says softly . " Jerry James . " <p> " David 's with the Sentinel , " Mike Frazier says , turning his head toward the other man . " He wants to learn all those secrets that make real hunters so successful . " <p> " Well , then , David , " says the fat beardless man . " You should be going out with a couple of real hunters , not these clowns . All you 'll learn from them is a bunch of bad jokes . That and how painful frostbite is . " <p> " I think I 've already learned that , " I say . " Well , I do n't doubt it , sitting in that jalopy . Did n't Mike light you a fire in the cab ? " <p> " Hughie , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We do n't want the boy to run back north without gettin ' to write me and Kenny up . " " Hugh Foster , " he says , pumping my hand enthusiastically . " Only lug-heads call me Hughie . So you 're a Yankee , huh ? " " That 's what they say , " I say . " Where'bouts you from ? " " New York . " <p> " NEW YORK ! Hell , son , you 're a long way from home ! How you like it down here in the South ? " <p> I never know how to answer this question . " It 's nice , " I say . " It 's very interesting . " <p> " Interesting ? Well , I 'd say so . This has to be about as different as anything you 've ever seen , right ? New York ! Can you imagine me in New York ? " <p> " I have a hard time imaginin ' you here in Mis'sippi , " says Mike Frazier <p> " New York ! Hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd last about two seconds in New York . Them niggers 'd eat me for breakfast ! " " For a week , at least , " says Mike Frazier , laughing . But Kenny Dunlap puts on a severe scowl , darting his eyes back and forth from Hugh Foster to myself . <p> " What the hell 's wrong with you , Kenny ? " Hugh Foster says . " The boy looks perfectly white to me . " Kenny Dunlap relaxes his frown , but faint traces of it linger on his lips . <p> " Green , was it ? " Hugh Foster asks . I nod my head . " You kin to the Greens down in Laurel ? " " I do n't think so , " I say . " That 's too bad for you , David . Those Greens are what we call good people . ' That means they 're rich as hell . Ross Green 's the Episcopal bishop for a bunch a counties down there , and ol ' Lanford Green owns just about all the lumber in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he asks , smiling . <p> " I suppose it 's possible , " I say , even though I know it 's not . My grandfather shortened his name to Green when he got to Ellis Island . " Well , I hope so , for your sake , " he says . " Damn it , Hughie , " Mike Frazier interjects . " Leave the boy alone already . He came here to hunt , not trace his roots . " " So Mike , you gon ' let the boy shoot ? " Hugh Foster asks . " Why , Hughie , so you can have the pleasure of turnin ' me in to the game warden ? When the hell do you suppose he got a license ? " " Well , hell , Mike , I never knew you were such a fine upstandin ' citizen . You know what I think ? " He pauses , but no answer is forthcoming . " I think you 're afraid the boy 'll bag one . " He turns to me . " David , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's why he never actually hits one when he shoots . " <p> " You 're a riot , Hughie , " Mike Frazier says . Then , looking at the ground , he laughs . I can see why : Hugh Foster has wrapped thick silver duct tape around the tops of both his boots . " That some kind a fashion statement ? " Mike Frazier says , pointing at them . <p> " Ai n't that a crime ? " Hugh Foster says . " I ai n't had these but a month and the seams split wide open . Both of ' em , right around the same time . " " A month ? " <p> " As God 's my witness , one month . I tried to take ' em back , too , but you know ol ' Rosenshein . That kind would n't part with a nickel if it was burnin ' a hole in his hand . " I look down at the ground . I do n't want to see where Kenny <p> Dunlap is looking this time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " A month . You done had ' em for ten years if you had ' em a day . Why do n't you just buy a new pair ? Sometimes I think you 've got a good bit of that in you , you ol ' bastard . " <p> " Well , then , I think I 'll just get back in my nice new truck , " Hugh Foster says . " I do n't need to be takin ' this . To think I left a lovin ' wife and a warm bed to come out here . " <p> " That was four years ago , Hughie , " Mike Frazier says . I look back up , just in time to see the four of them burst out laughing . They have all been through a divorce at some time or other . Mike Frazier and Hugh Foster have both been through two . Soon another truck pulls up with a trailer in tow , then a few more . My hosts introduce me to the other men as they emerge . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they all look vaguely alike , although I ca n't say how much of that has to do with their clothes . They talk and laugh and howl about the same things : how bad business is this year , how much harder it gets every year to drag themselves out to the hunt , how they got shafted by their ex-wives ' lawyers . I think one of them actually represented Hugh Foster 's last ex-wife in the divorce , or maybe it was Mike Frazier 's last ex-wife . <p> Maybe it was both of them . <p> " Well , boys , " Mike Frazier announces after about a half hour , " according to my watch " -he makes a show of looking at his wrist - " it 's time Kenny an ' David an ' me headed for our hole , which , by the way , is the best hole in these woods . " The other men growl and hiss , and then everyone starts shaking hands , wishing each other luck . " Nice to meet you , " they each say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Glad to make your acquaintance , David . Say boys , did you know David is kin to the Greens down in Laurel ? " The other men , the ones who did not witness the previous conversation , nod and make noises indicating they 're impressed . " Now , if you ever need any kind of tools or maybe some lumber , you come on down to the store . We 'll take good care of you , " he says , patting my shoulder . " Thank you , " I say . " I 'll keep you in mind . " " Keep between the ditches , son , " he says , winking . " What does keep between the ditches ' mean ? " I ask a few minutes later . We are in the boat now , puttering our way slowly through the swamp . A small light on the bow cuts through the blackness . Every few seconds or so , I have to duck under a tree limb . " You never heard that before ? " Kenny Dunlap says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like when you 're driving on a road , you have to keep between the ditches . Like , you have to stay in the middle of the road if you want to keep out of trouble . " " Oh , " I say . <p> " I sure hope you did n't fall for that line ol ' Hughie was pushin ' at you , " Mike Frazier says . " He kisses the Sentinel 's ass somethin ' ferocious . He 'll do anythin ' to get in good with you people . I think he 's plannin ' a run for City Council next year . He 's been talkin ' about it for a few years now . " We are moving right into the frigid wind and it 's tearing my face open . Also , something leaked into my left boot when I was climbing into the boat . My teeth chatter uncontrollably . <p> " I think this 'll help , " Kenny Dunlap says , reaching into his pocket . He pulls out a wool face mask and holds it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing them . I hesitate , remembering at that moment that Jack has stuffed his own face mask in the pocket of the jacket he loaned me . I had forgotten it was there . <p> " Do n't worry , David , " he says , pushing it into my hands . " I wash it every year . " I laugh and pull the mask over my head . It smells like soap . " We 're just about there , " he says . " I know this must not be very pleasant for you . " I shake my head and sink my chin into my knees , which are doubled up in front of me . There is n't much room in this boat for legs . It 's only about eight inches deep , and every few seconds , a brash black wave threatens to leap the two inches between the surface of the swamp and the rim of the boat . " Have you ever had so much fun in your life ? " Mike Frazier hoots . I ca n't tell if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envious he is of me . I picture him at this moment , lying in bed under a thick comforter . <p> " Turn here , Mike , " Kenny Dunlap says , pointing at nothing in particular . " Hell , I know that ! " he says , swinging the boat around . " How many times we been here ? What kind of fool you think I am ? " <p> Even though we must be moving in a different direction , the wind still hits me flat in the face . <p> " Well , this is it , " Kenny Dunlap says , pointing the light at a clump of trees poking their way up out of the water . " This is our hole . The Hotel . " ' " The hotel ? " I ask . <p> " Beats the hell out of the Ramada , do n't it ? " Mike Frazier says . " How can you be sure this is the right hole ? In the dark , I mean . " " Are you kidding ? " Kenny Dunlap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his sleep . " Mike Frazier shoots him a dirty look . " Besides , " he continues , " they mark the place . See ? " He moves the beam up the trunk of the biggest tree until it bounces off a metallic blue letter . He swings the light back and forth , but I ca n't discern any of the individual letters , much less read a whole word . I assume it says The Hotel . <p> Mike Frazier cuts the engine and lets the boat glide into the hole . " Used to not be this easy , " he grumbles . " Used to be a man had to poke around out here in the dark and fend for hisself . That 's when you could tell the hunters from the shooters . " The bow of the boat gently bumps wood . <p> Kenny Dunlap taps my shoulder . " You can take the mask off now , if you want , " he says . " It 's not so cold once we stop . " He has already taken his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trying to feel through my gloves for my notebook . " What is the difference between a ' hunter ' and a ' shooter ' ? " <p> " Kenny and I- " Mike Frazier starts , but I motion for him to stop . I pull the tape recorder out from under my legs and set it on my lap . I have to take my glove off so I can press the little red " record " button . <p> " Sorry , " I say . " Go ahead . " <p> " Well , like I was saying , Kenny and I are hunters . We 're not shooters . Shooters just want to bag their limit and go on home . But we do n't work that way . If that was all there was to huntin ' , we would n't be out here . It 's not the ducks that 's important . We come out here ' cause we like to play the game . " " You see , David , " Kenny Dunlap says , " the way we hunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved in just walkin ' up to a duck and shooting it . What makes it interesting for us is to beat the ducks on their own ground . This here is their home . They know it as well as we do , even better , ' cause they can see it from the sky as well as on the water , and we ca n't . So a gun does n't really do you any good . It just brings the ducks down once they get within range . The real challenge is to bring them into your range . Ducks are smart and they know why we 're out here . So we have to use our brains before we can use our guns . That 's what makes us hunters . " " Shooters do n't give a damn about that kind of stuff , " Mike Frazier says . " They just want the trophy . They go to these Cadillac Clubs ' up in Tallahatchie where they just sit inside and sip Brandy . And then some employee from the club will let one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shooters see it fly by , they just open their window and shoot . " I look at Kenny Dunlap . He winks and shakes his head . <p> Mike Frazier opens a big gray cloth sack that was sitting in between him and me . " What 's that ? " I ask . " Decoys , " he says , pulling one out of the bag . " Can I see one ? " <p> " He'p y'se'f . " I take off my gloves and pull one out of the sack . It is light , even with the round black weight that hangs from a footlong string attached to its underside . I flick my index finger against the wing . It 's plastic . The whole thing is . I am surprised . All the decoys I 've ever seen have been made of wood , a deep , rich wood covered with bright paint and a shiny varnish . Like this decoy , they did n't look much like a real duck , but it did n't seem to matter to them . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rows of leather-bound books in mahogany-paneled dens in Connecticut . More than content , really . They almost seemed to regard me with contempt as I admired them . " Does n't look much like a real duck , does it ? " Kenny Dunlap says . <p> " I do n't know , " I say . <p> " Well , you 'd be surprised . This would n't fool any of us for a minute , of course , but if you were a real duck and you were tired from flyin ' around gettin ' shot at all mornin ' , you would n't be too discriminatin ' ' bout choosin ' your friends . If something even looked halfway like a duck to you from a few hundred feet up , chances are you 'd plop down and say hello . After all , these ducks are lookin ' for food , and if they see other ducks settin ' around somewhere , they figure there 's got to be somethin ' to eat nearby . " " How many do you use ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I know guys who put out forty or fifty , but eighteen 'll do us just fine today . " " But how can the ducks see the decoys in the hole ? Would n't that mean they could see you too ? " <p> Kenny Dunlap laughs . " We do n't set them up here in the hole , " he says . " We put them out there . " He points out into the swamp . " About twenty-five yards out . That 's one of the three most important spots to a hunter , the place he lays his decoys . " " What are the other two ? The hole , and- ? " " The place you shoot the ducks , " he says . " Where 's that ? " <p> " Wherever you can , " Mike Frazier says . Kenny Dunlap lays the decoys out on the water , one a time . He pauses before setting each one down , running through a string of mysterious mental calculations that will determine where it belongs . When he is through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lashes it to a tree . The sun is starting to challenge the watery horizon . The sky turns a deep , rich blue , but the air is just as cold as it 's always been . Mike Frazier reaches under his seat and pulls out his bag of sausage rolls and a thermos . <p> " Coffee ? " he asks . " This is a fresh batch . It 'll warm you up . " " Thanks , " I say , reaching out for the cup he has just poured . " I do n't know what I 'd do in the morning without my coffee , " he says . " I swear , if I could figure out how to brew the damn stuff myself , I 'd get divorced and stay divorced this time . " I laugh . " Say , " he says , " I do n't see no ring on your hand . You divorced , too ? " <p> " Nope . Never been married . " " Ah , one a them confirmed bachelors , huh ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm only twenty-two . " " That do n't mean a damn thing , son . Hell , I was halfway to marryin ' my second wife by the time I was twenty-two . " <p> " ' Course , he was still married to his first wife at the time , " chimes a voice behind me . <p> " Dammit , Kenny , I 'm tellin ' a story here . So you never been married , huh ? Well , I 'll tell you this : you do n't know what you 're missin ' , and I do n't mean that as an insult . Hell , if I was twenty-two and single , I'd-well , you just take it from me . These southern gals have a whole lotta charm , but they 'll sink their claws into you if you give ' em half a chance . Have your fun , but you just be good an ' careful . " " I will , " I say . <p> Kenny Dunlap looks at his watch . " It 's gettin ' time , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the folded-up metal bar on the back of the boat . As they pull it up , I can see a brown mesh net webbed in between the folds . Here and there , a tan leaf pokes out from a hole . They pull the net straight up until it is about a yard high ; then they bend it , extending the rest of its length flat over our heads . I grab one of the leaves and pull ; it 's made of rubber . When I let go , it snaps back into the net . <p> " This is a duck blind , " Kenny Dunlap says . " Just to help us blend in a little better . " <p> So this is a duck blind . For some reason , I thought a duck blind would be something like a venetian blind . I laugh . " I know , " Kenny Dunlap says . " If we were disguised any better , even we would n't know we were here . But you ca n't be too careful with these ducks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do now ? " <p> " We set , " Mike Frazier says . " We set an ' we wait . " He looks at his watch . " Ducks 'll be by in twenty minutes , maybe less . " " What time is it ? " " Six-thirty . " <p> " How do you know when they 're coming ? " " You can hear ' em , " Kenny Dunlap says . " They have to communicate with each other when they 're flying . That 's how they know if another duck finds some food . " " So you just wait until they see your decoys ? " " No . We have to get ' em over here . By nature , they do n't fly over the open water . They know that 's where hunters are , so they stick to the wooded areas . We have to lure ' em over here- " he rips off a glove and burrows his hand into his coat - " with this . " He pulls out something that looks like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A call ? " <p> He blows into it . The sound resembles the flow of air out of a punctured tire . " Works like a charm , " Kenny Dunlap says . " And if you like that , I 'll have you know that ol ' Mike here blows the meanest call in the Delta . Show him , Mike . " <p> " When we hear ducks , " he says . " But we wo n't hear ' em if you keep jabbering . " <p> We sit in silence for a few moments ; then Mike Frazier speaks . " Shit , " he says . " Kenny , help me with these blinds , will you ? " " Coffee , huh ? " " Do n't you know it . " <p> Mike Frazier stands and turns his back on us . I hear him pull his zipper down . Then , the light drumming of liquid on liquid , first loud and fast , then softer , delicate . I snort . " Do n't be so quick to laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He 's right . As soon as Mike Frazier is through , I scramble to take his place . " You mind ? " I ask . <p> " Man 's got ta go , " Mike Frazier says , shrugging . I tuck my notepad under my arm , step up to the edge , and pull down my zipper . I feel guilty for laughing at Mike Frazier . The tinkle did sound funny when he was the one standing here , but now that it 's me , I ca n't believe how loud it is . " Damn , son ! " Mike Frazier says behind he . " Keep it down ! You 're scarin ' the ducks away ! " The two of them laugh . I 'm desperate for it to finish . Even before I 'm completely through , I start fumbling for my zipper . <p> I feel a light scrape against my side . Something flashes in the corner of my eye : It 's the notepad . It hits the water with a loud splash and sinks fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind me . " You pass a stone ? " " It was my notebook . " I start to go after it , but it 's already sunk out of sight , and the cold air rising off the water pushes me back . <p> " Lord have mercy , " Mike Frazier exclaims as I turn around . " Kenny , we better get us a doctor . The boy just pissed a notebook . " We laugh so hard that it takes all three of us to raise the blinds again . We 're still at it a few minutes later , when Kenny stops himself and puts a finger over his lips . I pull the tape recorder back onto my lap and press the little red button again . Mike freezes . Then , in unison , he and Kenny pull out their calls and start blowing frantically . <p> They do this for a minute or so and then , just as suddenly , they stop , grab their guns , and flip open the blind . Two ducks are about fifteen feet up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first , then Kenny , then the two of them fire again and again . I crouch down and cover my head . Smoke fills the air around us ; bits of twigs sprinkle down on my head . As the air clears , I sit back up , turn around , and see both ducks , unharmed about a hundred feet behind us , getting smaller with each squawk . " Christ , Kenny , " Mike says . " Tree-huntin ' season do n't even open for another month . " <p> " If I hadn'ta ducked , Mike , you were gon na shoot the hat off my head . " " Tough break , huh ? " I ask . <p> " Hell , " Mike says . " You never hit anythin ' with the first shot . That 's just to let them know the game is begun . The point is , " he adds , arching an eyebrow , " we 've already won . " <p> I shoot him a puzzled look . He sweeps his arm in an arc around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this mornin ' did you ? " he says . <p> " I guess not , " I say . My mouth rises to match his grin . " Besides , " he says , " I have it on very good authority that the ducks are gon na be out in full force today . They 'll be by again in a couple of minutes . I bet we have our limit inside of twenty minutes . " " Really ? " <p> " You wait and see . Tell you what , " he says , closing up his shotgun and handing it to me . " You try your luck . " " Wo n't you get in trouble ? " <p> " Hell , son , who 's gon na know ? Anyway , I 'm good buddies with just about every game warden in the state . " " You practically pay their salaries , " Kenny says . " I have no idea how to use this thing , " I say . " You mean you 've never fired a gun before ? Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just used to seein ' the business end pointin ' at you . " <p> " I 've shot at a rifle range before- " <p> " Well , this ai n't no different . Just aim and pull the trigger . She 's already loaded . " <p> I take the gun in my hands . It feels cold , solid , heavy . Good . It makes me bold . " Say , Mike , can I ask you a favor ? " I say . " Sure , what you need ? " <p> " Would you unload the shotgun and let me cock it ? " He takes the gun out of my hands , opens and closes it , and hands it to me . " Just slide this up and back , " he says , pointing to the black metal grip underneath the barrel . <p> I throw the grip out and pull it back in one quick jerk . The sound and feel of the shell being loaded into the chamber is sweet , like a snare drum being struck twice . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Get ready , David , " he says . He and Mike pull out their calls and start blowing . I steady the gun and slip my finger around the trigger . <p> Raising the barrel to the sky , I stare down its shaft and try to spot a duck in the sky . Suddenly , this big brown thing darts out in front of me . I jerk the gun to the left and it fires . The stock slams back into my shoulder ; my head tips back and bounces off the blind . The duck has disappeared but I can still hear its call ; it grows softer every time I breathe . <p> I sit up and hand the gun back to Mike , who is smiling and shaking his head . " Poor Hughie and Jerry , " he says . " What ? " I say . <p> " In about ten minutes , I figure , that buckshot 's gon na come rainin ' down on their heads . " Everyone laughs . " Now you let me show you how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He and Kenny blow their calls , but nothing happens . They honk and quack for about ten minutes , but the sky , now a light blue , stands unbroken . " What now ? " I ask . <p> " They 'll be along direckly , " Mike says . " The ducks heard our shots , " Kenny explains . " We just need to wait a few minutes , until they forget about it . Then they 'll come back over . " <p> We settle into a silence and drink the rest of the coffee ; Mike breaks out the sausage rolls and we all eat a few , even me . Minutes pass , but nothing else . <p> " I ca n't believe you forgot that damn heater , " Mike says . " Well , why do n't you keep it , then , " Kenny answers . " You 're the one who always wants to use it . " " Oh , you 're not cold now ? " " Not really . I can handle it . " " Bullshit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know , " I say . " I ca n't feel anything . " To my surprise , it 's Kenny who laughs first . <p> " I 'd like to shoot the sumbitch who told me the ducks 'd be out today , " Mike says . " I sure as hell coulda stood to stay in bed this mornin ' . " " Who 're you kiddin ' , Mike ? " Kenny bellows . " You have n't missed a day in season since I know you . Honest to God , David , one time , Mike here dragged me out when there was a tornado warning on . On the drive up here , this twister picks up a tree and throws it right in front of the truck . Mike gets out and moves that thing all by himself . You do n't think we 're gon na go into that swamp in a tornado ? ' I said . Hell , yes , ' he says , them ducks ' 11 just be droppin ' out of the sky today . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " You wan na be out here as much as I do . You 're making the boy feel bad . He had no choice in the matter . " <p> " You see , David , " Kenny says , " hunters are sick people . We force ourselves to come out here , day in , day out . It 's a good thing the season 's only thirty-one days long . If the fines were n't so steep , we 'd be out here year ' round . " <p> A shot goes off somewhere across the swamp . Then another , and another . <p> " Who you think that is ? " Mike asks . " Could n't tell , " Kenny shrugs . " Maybe Vic . " " O1 ' bastard . I 'll bet he 's just shootin ' at air , just to piss me off . " " He 's doin ' a pretty good job . " <p> " Now the ducks wo n't come around again for a while , that ol ' bastard . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter past eight , " he says . " I say we give it till nine . " <p> " Quarter of , " Mike says . " I got to get to that Phillips job . " " O.K. , " Kenny says . " David here wants to beat the deadline , I 'm sure . " " No , " I say , tapping the tape recorder purring on my lap . " I 'm going to need some time to listen to these tapes . I think we 'll probably hold this for Sunday . " <p> " Sunday ? " Mike says . " Jesus , that means everybody 's gon na see this . " <p> " We 'll be famous , " Kenny says , smiling . " It 'll be a big story , " I say . <p> " Listen , David , " Mike says . " Nobody has to know if we do n't catch anything . I mean , that 's not really important to the story . That 's not why we come out here . You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lots of times , we do n't bag anything at all , " Kenny says . " Not lots of times , ' Kenny , " Mike says sharply . " But once in a while . And then , a lot of times we bag our limit pretty quickly . " " About as often as we do n't get anything . " " Maybe a little less often . Anyway , David , my point is this : You just want to write a story about your average huntin ' trip , and since sometimes we 'll bag our limit right out and sometime we do n't have any luck at all , why do n't you average ' em out , say , and say we got two ducks . " " That sounds pretty fair , " I say . " Really ? " <p> " I 'll even have you bag your limit , if you want . " " You do n't have to go that far , " Kenny says . " Hush up , Kenny , " Mike hisses . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . " Who 's gon na know the difference ? " " Well that 's great ! " Mike says . " That 's mighty white of you ! " I look over at Kenny , but his face does n't betray any discomfort this time . " Well , hell , son , you feel free to come out here with us an time you want . You do n't even have to write it up ! " " Thank you . " <p> " You know , if you like huntin ' and outdoors stuff like that , there 's no better place than good ol ' Mis'sippi . Duck , quail , deer , dove . You do n't even need to hunt if you do n't feel like it . We got beautiful campin ' sites all over the place , and the fishin 's better than anywhere I ever been . Say-how long you down here for ? " " A year , " I say . " Maybe two . " <p> " A year ! Hell , I 'll bet anything after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you have up there in New York that you ca n't find down here ? " <p> " Excitement , " Kenny says . " Culture , fun , entertainment- " " Hush , Kenny . We got all that stuff down here , and , as if you did n't notice , we also got us the most beautiful gals in the world . And you can take ' em all out and still live like a king for what you make here . " " Do n't be so sure , " I say . <p> " Come on , David , a smart boy like you can write his own ticket . What else you got down here ? Rednecks and trash ? Folks like you and me and even Kenny are a rare thing , take my word for it . Someone like you can go far down here . " " Think so ? " <p> " Hell yes ! I think you should consider makin ' a home down here . Really , now , I 'm serious . " <p> " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You never know . " A few minutes later , Mike and Kenny agree to cut their losses and make better use of the rest of the morning . <p> Mike unlashes the boat and steers it out to the decoys . While Kenny bends over the boat 's edge to start gathering them in , Mike reaches into his coat and pulls out the bag with the sausage rolls . There 's only one left . " Want it ? " he asks me , but before I can answer , Kenny is hushing us . Tipping his head to one side , he looks at Mike and points a finger at the sky . In a few seconds , I can hear a group of ducks flying in over the edges of the swamp . " God damn ! " Mike says , a grin parting his mustache and beard , as Kenny scurries to put the decoys back in their places . " Those sneaky little bastards ! Waitin ' us out . I just knew they 'd show up as soon as we made ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " So this was intentional ? " " Does a bear shit in the woods ? ' Course we did this on purpose ! The day Mike Frazier does n't bag his limit you better start lookin ' out for the second coming . " <p> " Acting discouraged to fake out the ducks , " I say . " Pretty shrewd . " <p> " You bet , son . Stick with me , I 'll learn you right . Now you keep this in mind : Only a fool expects to bag his limit by seven thirty . If you wan na get the ducks up close and personal , you got ta wait for the sun to hit those decoys . " " I 'll remember that , " I say . " Come on , " Kenny says . " We 're gon na miss ' em all . " Already , a group of three or four ducks has passed over our heads . <p> Mike starts the boat up and moves it back to the hole . He lashes it to the tree , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls and start blowing a duck symphony . After a minute or so , they stop and let the calls drop out of their mouths . Kenny turns to me and gently touches one finger to his lips . He points another toward the sky and winks . <p> I crane my neck to sneak a look around the top of the blind . Then , I see it : A lone green-head is circling directly overhead about thirty feet ; it swoops in a broad counter-clockwise arc that starts in the upper right-hand corner of the blind , swings out over the decoys , then disappears into the other edge of the netting . A few seconds later , it reappears on the right and repeats the cycle . Kenny Dunlap reaches for the bar , but Mike Frazier grabs his arm . They both tighten their hands around the grips of their guns . <p> After a few more rotations , the green-head pulls itself to a halt directly over the decoys . It flaps its wings furiously in hovering and swings its bill back and forth ; then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . Just before it hits , it seems to freeze , webbedfeet pointed downward , white chest thrust forward , huge , rippling wings thrown out at its sides . It does n't look like a duck anymore . It 's an angel , swooping down from heaven . <p> I shudder and my knees jerk up , flipping the tape recorder off my lap and over the side of the boat . It hits the water with a triumphant splash . Mike Frazier instantly swings around toward me . The barrel of his shotgun knocks the camouflage cap off my head . My throat knots up . The duck is whipping its wings furiously . Kenny Dunlap throws the blind open and fires off a shot ; I flinch , but it is too late for him . The green-head is already safely away . <p> I turn toward Mike Frazier , and suddenly , I am looking down the black barrel of his gun . He holds it there , an inch away from my face . In my mind , I can see that mallard , flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be to have wings . And then Mike Frazier sighs and lowers his gun . " Damn , " he grumbles , looking at his friend . " God damn . Right out in front of us . " <p> " I know , " Kenny Dunlap says , shaking his head . " Guess it just is n't our day . " <p> " You can say that again , " Mike Frazier snaps . " That 's what we get for takin ' a New Yorker out with us . " I think I see a smile dash across his lips , but it is a cold , narrow smile . I wo n't let it bother me too much . At least I can swallow again . <p> 
##1003647 Everyone arrived in boots but it was too hot in the house to keep them on . Before long the air was skunky with the intimate aroma of winter feet , feet that had been sealed in leather and thick wool socks all day long . <p> Most of our guests were half-drunk and in an uncritical frame of mind when they arrived . Those who were n't wearing boots shed their shoes in the spirit of fellowship . <p> My girlfriend , Rocio Cantu , hated giving parties in this el norte country . She claimed she did n't know what white people liked to eat and drink . Even so , this party was her idea . " We go to parties , but we never give parties , " she said , explaining why this one was necessary . <p> This was a sore point between us . Her reluctance to entertain embarrassed me . We were poor . I 'd been out of work for almost a year , having quit my job teaching English as a second language in El Paso . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up just outside Mexico City . When her family moved to Juarez , she came north . She took my class at the community college , and I fell in love with her . I talked her into moving north with me . " It 's better up north , " I said . " No hassles , plenty of work , good pay . " It was a lie , but I 'd been in El Paso for five years and needed a change of scenery . I thought the north Rockies would be good for us . <p> Throwing parties was an expense our budget could n't tolerate . I knew this ; Rocio knew this . Another thing : whenever we talked about entertaining our friends as potential guests in our house , Rocio suddenly perceived them differently . They were no longer just our friends , but finicky strangers-guests . What do you give to a guest ? Guests are mysteries , they are full of unknown expectations . They come to you wanting happiness and cheer and good times , and how do you provide that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jugs of cheap wine , a pot of something hot-chili , fajitas , gumbo , stew . This takes no monumental effort . Even so , Rocio went catatonic . Such pockets of madness in the woman you live with are not negotiable . They are permanent topographical features of the psyche . You either learn to live with them or they 'll rip the bottom out of your love boat . Other things-the good things-even things out . My own unnegotiable psychic topography no doubt gave her some troubling thoughts . Most of our friends were also unemployed . Even so , they are reckless with their food stamps and brought over generous trays of hors d'oeuvres . They even brought booze , an eclectic show of partially filled bottles-vermouth , single-grain whiskey , gin , blended rotgut sold only in one-quart bottles , and tequila . <p> A friend of mine who had just gotten married gave me his old stereo that afternoon , the very afternoon my temperamental old Emerson decided to stop working . His new wife had a brand-new Marantz and so he gave me his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was fine by me . Benny Goodman , Coleman Hawkins , Zoot Sims , Johnny Hodges , Lester Young , Duke Ellington do n't require stereo , they come straight at you . <p> " Good crowd , " said Duane Mercator , my counselor from the Unemployment Office . " I see some of them from time to time down at the Job Service . My kind of people . " " Gold bricks to a man , " I said , offering him a tray of pumpernickel squares layered with blue cheese and prosciutto . Duane looked a bit out of place in his blue suit , paisley tie , and milky , blue-veined feet . Even so he maintained a kind of gloomy dignity that tended to make people keep their distance . He had a lean , hawkish face , the face of a brooding Sicilian , I always thought . Sometimes he seemed more like a Catholic prelate , a man of importance in Holy See politics . Actually , he 's an impressively accomplished amateur magician . " Got any good leads , Duane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher in this town , Tony , " he said . " This town is swamped with out-of-work professors . The Ph.D . mills are turning them out like Big Macs . McDoctorates are cluttering up the landscape . These people think they 're lucky to get hired as adjunct faculty at minimum pay with zilch benefits . And the system is happy to use them . In fact , it feeds on them . These people are vampire meat , Tony . " <p> His eyelids fluttered like willow leaves in a wind when he talked shop . Under the dancing eyelids , his pale gray eyes would travel upward and crescents of the moony , blue-tinged whites would show themselves . <p> The heavy wet wind of a late winter storm groaned against our little house . Taj Mahal rasped his blues through the single speaker . Morton Arthur , a big man with a ZZ Top beard , gave me a conspiratorial hug . " In your study , man , " he said , laying a finger against one side of his ruined nose . I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to share his coke . He had money to burn , unlike our other guests . He was our local celebrity . Any day now one of his science fiction novels was going to hit the charts . He wrote a kind of juiced-up 1930s space opera with cyberpunk features : nubile earth women doing crack on crater-pocked planetoids ; slave traders providing American teenagers to work the bug farms of the spider people from the Planet of the Arachnids ; hermaphroditic cowboys herding de-sexed human clones through underground labyrinths on Venus . <p> " Feel free , " I told him , but in truth I was uncomfortable with his habit . I glanced around the room to see if Rocio was watching . She did not approve of drugs . She always wore the red " I Am Drug Free " ribbon during drug awareness week in El Paso . <p> Mort had been busted in L.A. while working on a screenplay for a mid-budget but never-distributed SF shoot-'em-up called " Time Slot . " He 'd spent a month in jail , and then six more months doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local high school audiences about the dangers of drugs . Mort loved his drugs , and asking him to denounce them was like asking Jerry Falwell to promote child pornography . <p> " Champagne do n't make me crazy , Cocaine do n't make me lazy , Ai n't nobody 's business but my own , " Morton sang along with Taj Mahal . <p> Rocio came over to us , suspicious . " No drogs , " she said . " Desportes si , drogas no , " Morton said , laughing . It was a bumper sticker we 'd brought up from the border . It was on our refrigerator . It tickled Morton . Sports yes , drugs no . " What sports do you play , Rocio ? " he said . <p> In truth , he liked Rocio and Rocio liked him . Their play at hostility was a kind of running joke . But Rocio drew the line at hard drugs . " I mean it , Morton , " she said . " No pinchi drogas in this house . " <p> " Rocio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her name its rightful Spanish inflections . He passed his middle finger under his nose and inhaled noisily . " I have given up the filthy habit , Rocio . I sniff only taco pescado now . It 's cheaper and gets you almost as high . " <p> Rocio 's eyes got big for a second , then she laughed . " I do n't believe you , Morton , " she said , cuffing him lightly on the jaw . " You have a filthy mind . " <p> This little house we rent used to be a barn . Legend has it that a horse thief was hanged from its rafters . It 's a legend that happens to be true . I call it a legend only because hanged horse thieves in this part of the country are legendary . I found out this piece of history from Peter Selvig , a one-hundred-year-old ex-railroad conductor who lives across the street . He said that he witnessed the hanging . He no longer remembers the name of the thief . He remembers only that the man was tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joking among the grown-ups about whether he would slip the noose when they dropped him . Someone suggested tying a sack of feed to his feet so there 'd be enough weight to cinch the noose and snap his neck properly . Peter was n't supposed to be present-it was strictly a party for adults . But he and his older brother climbed unnoticed up a ladder in the far end of the barn and hid behind a stack of hay in the loft . It was New Year 's Eve , 1899 , and the thief was to be hanged at the stroke of midnight , ushering in the bright new thief-free century . Peter remembers the condemned man 's face clearly as the sheriff 's deputy put the noose around his long , thin neck . The expression in the thief 's eyes , Peter said , was something to behold . It was calm and peaceful and , in a strange way , generous . It suggested something extra-human to little Peter , though he could not have articulated this at the time . The look on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his mind . It remains vivid almost a century later . Peter , who is on the edge of his own precipice , has something of this same unafraid look . His foggy old eyes are peaceful and generous . I like Peter a lot and we spend many afternoons in his backyard whittling on pieces of maple . These afternoons are so enjoyable that I 'm almost glad to be out of work . <p> Desportes si , trabajo no . <p> After about six hours the party broke up into sub-parties . There was a group in the bedroom making militia jokes , a north Rockies pastime . Three wives sat on the sectional discussing the merits of bulk buying from discount warehouses . Mort Arthur had collected half a dozen people and had taken them into the double-size closet I call my study . I went with these . There were about six of us . " I lied to Rocio , " Mort said to me . <p> He dismantled a picture frame to get at the glass . Then he chopped some generous lines . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short , and we passed the glass around the small room like a communion palette . I was worried Rocio would come in . She had started going to church again after a tenyear layoff and had hung her grandma 's old crucifix above our bed-a dark , twisted Savior carved out of stubborn mesquite by an eccentric but faithful artisan . Under the black eyes of that Indian Jesus , Rocio was becoming less and less willing to participate in the mild exercises of foreplay . There was no telling what new extreme she might be pushed to if she barged in on Mort 's cocaine ceremony . <p> I went back to the living room . Rocio had gotten uncharacteristically tipsy . Someone had brought a bottle of Irish Cream , and she indulged herself . She likes candy , and Irish Cream is the candy of hard drink . Manitas de Platas , the gypsy guitarist , was on the Sanyo , and Rocio , who claimed three-eighths Spanish blood , was demonstrating the flamenco . For castanets she was using spoons . Her skirts were flying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin line of sweat gleamed on her temple . Perfume and pheromones mixed and radiated like woodstove heat from her spinning body . Who is this woman I 've tied my life to ? I asked myself , knowing the question was stupid as well as central . <p> I went into the kitchen where Duane Mercator was doing a magic trick at the insistence of a small crowd . " Everybody sit down and close your eyes , " Duane said . <p> I sat on the floor , back against the wall . A woman I did n't know sat next to me . She offered me a hit from her joint , which I refused . " I ca n't mix my chemicals , " I said . She shrugged and passed it the other way . " I 'm going to count slowly to ten , " Duane said , his voice beautifully modulated . We could have been in Las Vegas , watching an expensive act . His voice was the voice of a professional master of ceremonies . It made you feel that you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employment office feeling that important jobs were being lined up for you . <p> When he finished counting , the woman sitting next to me slumped down . The mota dropped from her fingers . I picked it up and passed it to my left . I let my head thunk against the wainscoting of the wall behind me , giving in to a sudden post-cocaine fatigue . Duane said , " I want you to think of a white wall . It 's fifty feet high and a hundred feet wide and it is pure , unblemished white . " The woman next to me slowly raised her head off the linoleum . " I see it , " she said . <p> " Think of this wall , " Duane said , " as a place of complete peace . It is untouched by petty aggravations . No graffiti can mar it . Nothing has ever marred it . It was clean at the beginning of time , it is clean now , and it will be clean at the end of time . It is the wall that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woman . " I 'm going snow-blind . " I did n't see any wall . Maybe a pale spot , wide as a quarter . But I had to push it to believe it . " Try not to be so cynical , " Duane said to me . I guess he read the expression on my face . <p> I made an honest effort . The little pale spot widened . This interested me . <p> " Now , " said Mercator . " Open your eyes . " <p> I opened my eyes . The pale spot was still there . Not fifty feet tall , but definitely there . Mercator opened the oven door . He took a bottle of milk out of the fridge and put it into the oven . He turned the oven on and set the dial to " Bake . " <p> " I 'm going to start counting again , " he said . " When I reach twenty , I 'll open the oven . He reached twenty , then opened the door again . The bottle of milk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duane took the package out and removed the heavy brown wrapping paper that covered it . He tore the paper off the package and opened the box . A kitten raised its head and mewed . Duane closed the oven door . He counted to twenty again . Then he opened the oven again . Inside was the bottle of milk . He got a saucer out of the cupboard and poured some milk into it . I could see , from the way it steamed , that it was warm milk . The kitten ran to the saucer and began lapping it up , her tail erect and quivering with pleasure . We applauded . I got up and went back into the front room . For some reason , <p> Duane 's magic trick had bothered me . The white haze he 'd called up was still with me . It flared around the living room like a halo . Rocio had finished dancing and was now sitting on the sofa sipping Irish Cream . <p> I went down to the basement to lie down and watch television , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched part of a T- &-A; movie on the Playboy channel . Then I switched to one of the Christian channels where a pair of evangelists , a man and a woman , told their audience how at one time they did not have a measurable ounce of faith . " Hey ! " the woman cried out with the elan of a cheerleader , " Look how far we come ! " <p> I slept for a while . When I woke , the party was over , our guests were gone . I found Rocio sitting on the floor of the shower stall . She sat with her knees pulled up , her arms crossed on her knees , her head on her arms , while tepid water lashed her brown back , the knuckles of her spine shining like wet stones . <p> I turned off the water . " Come on , let 's go to bed , honey , " I said . She sobbed . One big , ragged sob . This is where she goes when she is sad , the shower . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her breasts turn outward in their fullness . I read that somewhere once-a generously erotic phrase-and it applies to Rocio . When she got her feet under her , I wrapped her in a towel . <p> I locked up the house and we went to the bedroom . She collapsed on the bed in a careless sprawl-her thighs loose in a parody of invitation . I knew from experience that it would have been a mistake to misread the moment . I left her there , her eyes half open , her mind halfway back to the slopes of Chapultepec . <p> I cleaned up the house , put the coke-dusty glass back into the picture frame , washed the dishes . When I went back to the bedroom Rocio was kneeling at the head of the bed , kissing the gnarled mesquite feet of her grandmother 's Jesus . She was still weeping , silently , and I knew that we would soon be going back to the border . I knelt beside the bed , stroked her calves and her feet . They were perfect feet-long , narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , traced the delicate webbing of veins under the transparent skin , the bleak and startling rise of the ankles . <p> As she kissed the feet of her grandmother 's Jesus , I kissed the fragile spray of bones that reached down from her instep and ended at the toes : for they too were fossils of starlight that had not forgotten their radiant freedom . <p> 
##1003648 It had begun the night before . All night , as if a frame were ripped from the continuum . She would be drifting toward sleep , that delicious tenderness , and then a yank . She blamed it on hunger and ate cereal . She blamed it on stress and then thought of each muscle , attempted to breathe through her calves , her neck , her pores . But each time she fell , swimmingly , deeper , she jerked . And so she then accepted that this was now her rhythm . For the time being , this was the way of Luz s life-a hum and then a thud , or rather , a hum and then a scrape . With a thud there is a bottom , heaviness , resting . But the scrape-a shock of adrenaline , an interruption which is not an end , but chaos . And to conceive the thing-to remember that flowing moments were interrupted by shrillness , to remember it at all-was to bring it about . <p> She had not slept or she had slept the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diner . The chicken soup had been the perfect chicken soup , with just a touch of oil , those tiny ragged hoops on each spoonful . The vegetables ' exquisite density and the place was nearly empty and it was quiet and she forgot . And then her teeth scraped iron , rust , and the wince lasted a full minute . She recalled it sitting , later , on the edge of the fountain and her face reconstructed the expression . She turned away as if she sat before something awful . <p> Luz did not like this cringing over nothing . It was a sign of weakness . It angered her the way Greggy angered her with those small circles on her back-comforting when what one needs to do is collect oneself . Soothing when what a gal should do is face the task and get on . Those circles-those were a shriek in the flow . In those moments , he repulsed her . His pathetic , womanish , comfort . Luz , the practical one . Luz , who never got colds and who knew allergies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willed her own hives away after an incident or two with shrimp . She had little tolerance for others ' self-defeat . Sweater-wimps , who got so used to heavy clothes early in the season that they needed them daily-girls who cried over boys who never loved them anyway and worse-they who worried over what might happen . They were appalled at Luz 's summer job last year . She worked in a day care center and they had a boy who , every chance he got , went sprinting through the hallways . They spoke to him sternly , took his cookies away , called his mother , and still , at some random moment , moments that corresponded only to his caretakers ' relaxing , bam ! he was out in the hallway , yelling incomprehensibly , laughing uncontrollably . It was the laughing that pissed them off the most . The workers were half wide-hipped , middle-aged women and half agile teenagers , and eventually they would trap him between some combination of leaps and steadfastness . And then someone would have to watch him and his little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the day . It seemed his goal to get them twice in one day , but that they were usually able to control . <p> It was Luz 's fifth year at the day care center and at the ripe age of twenty they had given her her own room and included the sprinter . Be careful , warned Mrs. Ruhala , waving her knotted finger , keep an eye on that one . Luz had been one of the agile leapers for a number of these occurrences . She had skillfully driven the sprinter into the wall of Mrs. Ruhala 's hips . Mrs. Ruhala felt she was honoring Luz with a challenge as the youngest worker with her own classroomnot only that , but the sprinter as well . <p> Luz had had a different understanding . She understood that they liked these little parties . They liked gathering all the thick-andsturdy women and narrow , reaching girls into the hallway while the rest of the children stood sucking their thumbs in the doors . That this was the only time their pulses quickened . Mrs. Ruhala @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Joanna , you watch Adrienne 's group and Adrienne , you close off the far end . " Adrienne had been the last leg of the relay in high school . This was the only story they told when they got home . Luz knew they expected her to fail . <p> Luz did something brazen . She shut the door . June passed without incident . Mrs. Ruhala noticed . She said , " You ca n't do that . Children need air . " <p> As a testament to Luz 's hard work , there was a strand of black hair leaking from her rubber band . " The windows are open , " Luz carefully explained . <p> " Open the door , " Mrs. Ruhala said , over her shoulder , waddling with her gray legs one after the other to the audible sounds of nylon on nylon . She got quite a distance before she turned and added , " It 's a fire hazard . " <p> Luz came in with one of those accordian-like things people put at the top of stairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to open that anyway , " Mrs. Ruhala said . The sprinter was now nearly seven . Luz showed that it took a good six seconds to unhitch the thing , plenty of time for an agile teenager to leap and gather small flailing limbs to her bosom . " It 's a fire hazard , " Mrs. Ruhala said , and Luz unhitched the thing again , in the same six seconds . " Take if off , " Mrs. Ruhala said . " I think he needs counseling . I think he has problems at home . " She whispered this last part and tilted her thumb , glugging . Luz was disgusted and quit . And yet here was Luz , fearing the heaves and bringing them on . Allowing the disturbance . She had been on a walk , thinking , all day . She was on the edge of a fountain . The rushing water and the nottoo-distant traffic were distilling into sameness . These were the early days of spring and Luz wore her winter coat but wore it open , so that the breeze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a problem with her muscles , kinking , feeling solid and not aligned as well as usual . She was furious with Greggy . He had recently proposed . <p> Four years ago , he had stood on her stoop with his bicycle while his girl-cousin wandered off . A girl Luz knew from school , not really a friend , but a girl she knew well enough to make an introduction . His name was Greggy , from Gregorio , and he was a bit older and in college . He asked her if she wanted ice cream and she said she was too full . He asked her if she liked the air show and she said no and then he stood there . He stood there swallowing and she stood on the stoop with her arms folded waiting for him to go away . He was too skinny for her taste , and short , and his smile had a tic in it . <p> And then the next week they rode by again , Greggy and his girlcousin , and waved from a distance and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride by-a Filipino , from the islands themselves , who does n't stop to chat , us talkers , how ridiculous-there would have to be a reason and that was clearly cowardice . But the third timeshe realized he would never stop to chat unless she waved him over . And she was a little disgusted with the way he so easily accepted the changing of her mind . The way there was not the slightest touch of resistance to her hints . Oh I 'm so hot , she said , and it was n't hot in the least , and he took her for a pop . <p> Greggy was a malnutritioned little runt , really , thin as Luz 's pinky . She had about thirty pounds on him and she herself was slim . He had no qualities of self-protection . When they argued-he never hung up , and when she did , all she had to do was stand by the phone and count to three . He never went home when she was grumpy . He remained patiently in the periphery . She looked left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to turn back . She might have been thoroughly rude and he would apologize . If she married him , she would always be the bad one , always a little guilty . <p> And in Luz 's shrieking flowing day there was both a sensual acuteness and a certain dullness . She had been walking into people . She had had one of those days on which , whenever she met people on the sidewalk , she moved to the same side they did . Because she never met their eyes , she would switch to the left or gesture again to the right and be stuck in that awkwardness . She would laugh a stupid little laugh and wait for the people to walk around without having seen their faces . She would hear their small , frustrated exhales . And yet-in moments , she swore she could hear the difference between the squeaks of cranes in the distance and the chugs of buses . She could tell adult voices from children , laughter from yells-all in the distant din . She had had the perfect soup , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon , she could still taste the salty broth and in one place on her lip , toothpaste . This , and then iron , rust . She felt she understood lightning . It had everything to do with tension . <p> Luz smoothed her coat beneath her and shifted a bit on the cement . The park was rather empty , just a couple of bums and teenagers playing hooky . She crossed her legs and put her chin on her hand . <p> The teenagers were sharing a pack of cigarettes across the way . A boy held a pack toward a girl with one white , slim tube sticking out . <p> Luz fell to musing . Her musing remained within a small fixed radius . She was sure that if she could relax , and let her mind wander , the decision would be made unconsciously , would be ready and waiting for her when she returned . She exhaled as if to cool the perfect soup , and yet her thoughts could not escape that pole . She traveled the tiny space between two images of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she had left her job at the day care to visit his job at the pet store . It had been busy . He had been flustered . A woman waved a pretzel-like doggy toy overhead and asked if they had it in softer material . Greggy 's boss was asking , " Do you need quarters , I said do you need quarters , I 'm leaving now , do you need quarters ? " While Greggy tried to answer a number of questions at once , Luz stood off to the side smoothing her hair , looking around , and somebody 's dog urinated . The woman apologized for the animal , and offered to clean it up , but Greggy insisted that it was okay , smiling weakly , and got the mop . Other people were waiting in line while he mopped . " It 's okay , mum , " he said , with his accent , and Luz worried that the woman thought he 'd called her mother . <p> Luz waited ten minutes and he was still too busy to speak to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while . He would say , " Just one minute , " pleadingly , but finally she could not stand it anymore , and left . For some time afterward , Luz would associate Greggy with the smell of urine , that weak , embarrassed smile edging over his face , as if he 'd done it himself . <p> The Tagalog word bolero has , of course , evolved from the original Spanish term for the musical form . A bolero/a is a practicer of something between charm and bullshit . It is closer to charm in that it does not necessarily have a negative connotation . It is a mode of flattery , understood by both speaker and listener to be designed for the listener 's elevation . It is closer to " bullshit " in that it has no necessary relation to the truth . Bola supposes no such absolute . The ends are an inflated sense of self . The desire of the bolero to bestow bola upon a particular subject is a compliment in and of itself . There is only so much bola and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This brings us to the opposite end of the twopoint radius , Luz 's other image of Greggy . <p> Now nearly two years ago , she was at a party with many people from both her own and Greggy 's crowd . All of her favorite people were there , save her very best friend Maria Luna Saguid , who had been sent temporarily away to console a grieving relative . Maria Luna 's boyfriend , Cesar , was there . He was one of the more popular young men of their set . He played soccer , was broad-shouldered , slim-hipped , and elusive enough to keep the desire for his company alive . He would make his jokes and be on his way , demonstrate his charms and disappear . <p> Luz was watching him . When he was between conversations , he was so antsy that his fingers curled and uncurled against his sides . He would make his way to groups and open the circle through some gesture of affection . He slung his arm over another boy his age , said something with a hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , and then Cesar left . <p> But usually he spoke with girls . He said things quietly from beneath his bangs . He grinned . They had to lean in to hear things and then they punched him lightly in the arm . He had tremendous teeth . <p> One girl , a girl with wavy hair and slow , patient blinks , did n't appreciate Cesar 's conversation and folded her arms , and then he moved on and was speaking with another girl for too long . Her name was Kitty Tolentino . Everyone knew her . She was very pretty in a way that was far too crude for Luz 's personal taste . She was plump and her sweaters were tight and her voice was a high-pitched whisper . Kitty and Cesar had to press their ears to each other 's faces to be heard . Cesar 's voice would fall when he was flirting . Kitty 's was always weak . Luz knew that if Maria Luna was to learn how long Cesar spoke to Kitty and what it looked like , Luz herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell . This was the first thing that set Luz on edge . <p> But it was when Cesar approached her himself that she became very irritable . He spoke in audible tones from a respectable distance . There was nothing the least bit male-female in his approach . She had watched him all night , baring his gleaming teeth to all the girls , from the most popular to the shyest and least desired . He had made Regina giggle . Regina had a thick scar from a harelip , and here he was with his cup of punch , asking Luz how she liked school . His punch was swirling because he could n't keep still . He payed no attention to her answer . And then he was gone and back to Kitty . <p> Greggy asked Luz to dance . Luz said no she did n't want to dance and " Greggy , " she said , " you are a poor dancer anyway . " And then he stood there with his still punch , turning red . Cesar radiated into Kitty Tolentino across the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By the time he walked away , enough time had passed that this departure had no necessary relation to her insult . <p> But Greggy came back with Luz 's mother . He walked upstairs to the chaperones ' room , where the parents were reveling in their further-practiced bola , and brought back Luz ' s mother . Every kid in the basement straighted just a bit and Luz 's mom , being honored as the only mother on the dance floor , lit up just like Kitty Tolentino . And then Greggy came back with his own mother and his aunt and eventually Luz was quite touched by all the blushing older women with their swaying black buns and Greggy 's noble and reserved style . And Luz felt everyone was right when they said there are two kinds of men in this world . <p> Luz turned from the image of Greggy in the pet store to Greggy dancing with the glowing older women and back until she was completely disgusted with herself and then she fixed upon the people who had arranged themselves on the benches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a play and a rather juvenile production at that . She felt this because the previous scene , the teenagers with their cigarettes , had been replaced without transition , without perceptible exit or entrance , and because the people across from her were arranged self-consciously against each other like poor actors . They were also absurd-looking people . <p> The woman in the center was heavy and pale white . She had a taut , smooth skin that usually belongs to thinner , darker people . It was as if the extra chin were as natural a part of her body as the cheekbone or the hairless , soft underneath of a forearm . She also had rolls in her cheeks . She seemed to be wrinkling in huge bunches rather than tiny folds , and her aging had gathered two bulging tubes of flesh which stretched and gleamed like muscles beneath her eyes . <p> It seemed the woman in the center was being comforted . She had light brown hair and glasses and there were two men angled against her from either side , much smaller people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his head against the top of her head . They were not actually in a position to lean , for one skull to feel the pressure of the other . From the left , the person had reached his arm over the woman 's shoulders . He was quite small , and his whole body lifted with the gesture . His behind was not on the bench . The whole scene appeared resolutely uncomfortable . <p> Luz 's eyebrows visibly bunched . The woman was speaking slowly and methodically and Luz , over the rush of the water behind her , tried to tune in . The men on either side were nodding in agreement . For a moment , Luz felt she 'd caught a thread , felt she 'd heard , " But , I- " the opening that would widen , through which the information would pour . But then Luz thought she heard a language that was not English . It had the harsh consonants of German but none of the rhythms . It was no language she recognized . It was not Slavic , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could place . It did not sound like they were speaking a language of Europeans . It was driving her crazy . <p> The small man from the right smoothed the hair of the woman . Their expressions were all very serious and heavy . Luz thought of moving to sit near them , but decorum subdued her . She could think of no subtle way of getting near them . If she walked past , it could be in a moment they were silent . She felt again that they were speaking English . She saw that the woman was devastated . <p> Luz felt that if she only concentrated hard enough she could catch that whipping tail , a thread of conversation , and she attempted this for some time . The woman shifted . She touched her head against the man on the right and the left one was lifted awkwardly at an angle . Luz tried everything within her power to hear from where she sat , and then she realized this was as silly and childlike as when she had prayed for dolls to appear out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take her chance and walk by as closely and slowly as possible . Luz stood up and then her mind had wandered enough . She had been distracted enough to have the decision ready and waiting for her . A constriction had burst , her thoughts could go anywhere . If she did n't answer Greggy now , or if she said no , he would only wait for her , she would be making the decision for the rest of her life . <p> 
##1003649 There was a season when all Paula 's clothes looked like paintings . The clothes she wore were never quiet-she chose colors and textures as if they were something she 'd eat later , alone in the privacy of her kitchen , juice running down her chin . The painting clothes she cut herself from lengths of cloth : rayon , because she liked the drape of it , the way the wrinkles yielded to the pressing of her iron . I was a little in love with her , so I was willing to listen while she told me about the properties of cloth , the weft and wale of it , the way it would hold a seam . <p> Her hair was short then , eyes made huge by wispy black bangs that pressed toward her face as if a strong wind were hurrying past from behind . The painting clothes were long and full . Dresses reached ankles , blouses swept thighs . Broad brush strokes of color swept across her . Gesturing with her hands , cloth fluttering around her , she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up then , though I had the appearance of one who was n't trying . I was into blues and grays : faded jeans and chambray , worn T-shirts that emerged from the dryer soft as skin . My clothes were n't meant to distract or enhance , they were meant to melt away . I knew what was best about me was long and lean , my fingers , the bones of my thighs . I looked careless but neat ; my long hair carefully combed , my nails trimmed short . I was ready for anything but laid back , perched on a branch with a view like a large , predatory cat . <p> From this vantage I 'd imagined Paula in every position , her eyes open as the night sky in a place far from the city . In my mind she 'd been mine a hundred different ways , though she rarely paused to look at me when I visited . Her attention was given instead to a dressmaker 's dummy , the kind with adjustable waist and hips and breasts . This dummy had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to achieve the proper fit for the wedding gowns and prom dresses that were the mainstay of her business . We called her Trish . Her rigid stance made a lie of the measurements Paula had so carefully taken . Gowns that fit Trish perfectly would pinch their prospective owners , and her legless body ignored the stretch of cloth across thigh . I liked Trish best when she was set up to mimic Paula : small high breasts and a trim waist giving way to hips that Paula said were all out of proportion but to me were absolutely delicious , swelling like a droplet of water about to give way . <p> I was good for business , Paula said , hanging around her shop the way I did . Women like me-they always have . I 'd be sitting on the cutting table when they came in for fittings , and I 'd make no bones about watching as they made their shy way behind the screen to change . The bolder ones would drape their undergarments over the top of the screen , silky black slips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outfits they were buying . They 'd emerge with their gowns unfastened , turn their backs to me for assistance with zippers and eye hooks . They liked my long fingers on their clothes , the way I 'd narrow my eyes , then nod approvingly . They assumed I was Paula 's man and Paula would play along for them , kiss me on the cheek or pat my thigh , call me babe . When the women were gone , there were pins in her mouth when she turned my way . <p> There were other seasons of course : a winter of velveteen , a spring of clothes that laced like old-time corsets , a summer when everything had scarf hems . Paula 's clothes fit perfectly , they presented her body the way a wooden bowl offers fruit on a kitchen table-without hesitation or coyness . But Paula 's clothes did more than clearly outline her lovely body-they transformed . Without gaining or losing a pound Paula could go from German beermaid to street waif . Sometimes I found myself wondering if I knew who she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part of me that believed that when I finally had her pinned beneath me , making whatever sort of sounds she made , I 'd know who she really was-her response to me would give that away . <p> I was so very full of myself . <p> Because she was so hard to know I underestimated her power . She kept things I liked to drink in her refrigerator , and that led me to believe she had a place for me in her heart . <p> I was pleased with the present she gave me for Christmas . I could tell she 'd put a lot of thought into it ; the blue-gray of the cloth perfectly matched my eyes . It was a poet shirt , or so she told me . The sleeves were wide , the cloth gathered in tiny tucks at the shoulders and yoke . It was made of pima cotton , smooth and crisp , and she 'd washed and dried it twice to break it in . What I liked best was the way it fit . She 'd had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the fingers of her mind . It was cut fuller than other shirts I owned ; tucked into the waist of my Levi 's it made the rest of me look slim . <p> Paula folded a printed scarf into a neat band and tied it beneath my bangs . In the mirror I saw a pirate . She put her hands on my hips and turned me toward her , kissed me lightly on the lips . I tried to draw her into my arms , to follow her mouth with mine . But she pushed me aside as easily as one moves a curtain to look out a window , her eyes focusing on something in the distance . In no time her hands were ministering to Trish again and I was just a figure on the cutting table , reclining just so , always aware of the impression I was making . <p> One afternoon she came up behind me , put her arms around my waist . She held me loosely , and I could feel her breasts through my shirt and hers . " Close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Now open your hand . " She placed something small and round in the center of my palm . " Know what it is ? " she asked . <p> I said I thought it might be a condom , though whatever it was seemed too small and hard for that . <p> " You wish , " she said . " Open your eyes . " It was an earring , a hoop of gold that dangled from a wire . " Fourteen carat , " she said . " You need it to go with your shirt . " She flicked my lobe with a fingertip . " Right here , " she said . <p> A part of me considered the earring too big , too bright and brassy for a man . Her finger traced the curve of my ear . She was pressed against me ; I could feel her thigh curving into mine . <p> " I 'll take care of it , " she said , " I 've got everything we need in the kitchen . " <p> I nodded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on one of her kitchen chairs , took a needle and cork from a cabinet , pulled ice and a bottle of Mescal from the freezer . She raised the bottle to her lips and I saw her throat move twice . " Steadies the hands , " she said . She gave me the bottle , and I took a slug . " This will feel a lot like that did , cool and hot , then fading away . I 'm going to sit on you . " <p> " Make yourself at home . " <p> She straddled me , handed me a cube to hold against my ear . " Left side , " she said . " You like women , right ? " <p> I held the ice to my ear , feeling first cold and then pain and then not much at all . " Ready ? " <p> I took the ice away and she put the cork behind my ear , moving closer as she did , her legs sliding up mine in a way that was anything but painful . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . <p> There was a pinching pain in my left ear lobe , as if someone were squeezing it with a pair of pliers . <p> " We 're through , " she said . " Hand me the earring . " She dunked it in a jigger of Mescal , threaded it through the hole in my ear . She licked away the tequila that trickled down my neck . Then she brought me a mirror so I could see the pretty work she 'd done . The hat was for Paula . It was a bowler , she told me , and though I recognized the shape I never would have known the name . Its rounded top and curled brim accentuated the curves of her cheekbones . She disappeared into the bathroom to fool with it in front of the mirror . When she came out it seemed that her little blond mustache had somehow darkened , her eyebrows thickened beneath the brim . She took the hat off and tossed it into the air . Her bangs were combed away from her face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replaced the hat , looking from the neck up like a mischievous boy . <p> A few weeks later she talked me into piercing the other ear . " Lots of men have an earring on both sides now , " she said . She got the Mescal , and I let her do as she pleased . <p> She was working on a beautiful shawl-collared coat , a smoking jacket , she called it . It was made of black silk embossed with tiny paisleys , with a satin collar and belt . Trish was set up to mimic Paula so I figured she was making the jacket for herself . She was also making a sea-green satin evening gown for a woman so large she could n't use Trish as a model . She showed me the measurements and they were huge for a woman-forty inches across the chest , a thirtytwo-inch waist , thirty-six-inch hips . " She wants it off the shoulder and she 's built like a linebacker , " Paula said . " Her shoulders are probably as broad as yours . " <p> Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so she could measure me . There was a remarkable similarity between my measurements and those of Paula 's customer ; my hips were a little slimmer than hers , and I was half an inch shorter , according to Paula . <p> " You have nice shoulders , " she said , nuzzling them for a moment . Then she helped me back into my shirt . <p> Because she touched me , she could get me to do what she wanted . I was always anticipating . In my mind each move led to another , rolling and tumbling and gaining momentum until she somehow ended up lying beneath me on my bed , her bed , the floor , the cutting table . She could split a pencil line with a pair of scissors . <p> Her deftness would come in handy , I figured . I ca n't explain how she pulled it off . I could tell you that she fed me fresh summer cherries one by one until my lips and her fingers were stained crimson . That she stroked the soles of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into butterflies that fluttered over my skin as if I were the most delectable flower . That she asked me nicely , taking my face in her hands and whispering pretty please . <p> She told me that I 'd be doing her a big favor , that she would n't be able to get the darts that gave the dress its hourglass shape positioned correctly unless she could try it on a model . I could have asked her why she did n't get the dress ' s future owner to stop by . But I guess I knew by then . <p> I 'd never felt satin against my skin . She let her fingers wander , adjusting the cloth , gathering and pinning , somehow giving the dress a shape that was n't mine . We were standing before a fulllength mirror . There was a bottle of tequila at our feet . I 'd never noticed that she was as tall as I was . She dropped her silk shift on the floor and worked on me in just a black , push-up bra and panties . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I was a little drunk . She put some jazz on the stereo , left me to sit on the cutting table in just my Jockeys while she finished the dress . I brought the bottle to my lips . I was n't used to seeing my bare shoulders in candlelight . She combed my hair away from my face , sweeping it high above my forehead . Moments before she 'd let me take a cherry from between her breasts with my teeth . I tried to get things unhooked but she told me I 'd have to wait . Her voice was stern but her eyes were laughing . I did n't know if I was in on the joke or the butt of it . The music swirled around us like gusts of wind . I found myself swaying in a satin dress . I pulled her to me and she allowed it . In the mirror two women danced . <p> After a while she pushed me away . She drew a couple of chairs up to the mirror , sat me down so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she made me up . Shadow the color of a sweet sugary mint was applied to my eyelids . My lips became a rose . She had a necklace and earrings ready , and green flats . She looked at my hairy wrists and sighed . Then she disappeared into her bedroom . Moments later she emerged in the black smoking jacket and pants with a black satin stripe up each leg . The bowler rested jauntily on her head and she carried a cane . She had black , square-toed boots that made her just a little taller than me . The jacket was tied loosely ; angled just right I could see her lacy bra . She said she was taking me out . <p> She handed me a purse-a green clutch . She asked me to hold her money , gave me what looked to be a roll of twenties . Then she headed for the door . <p> I followed her . I was watching myself in the mirror . I moved awkwardly , skittering along in my flats . She was all grace and confidence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met hardwood floor . My eager fingers clasped the purse . I looked expectant , but there was more to it than that . I reminded myself of my mother . In my eyes you could see the hope and silent plea . <p> 
##1003650 Mr. Chiu and his bride were having lunch in the square before Muji Train Station . On the table between them were two bottles of soda spewing out brown foam , and two paper boxes of rice and sauteed cucumber and pork . " Let 's eat , " he said to her , and broke the connected ends of the chopsticks . He picked up a slice of streaky pork and put it into his mouth . As he was chewing , a few crinkles appeared on his thin jaw . <p> To his right , at another table two railroad policemen were drinking tea and laughing ; it seemed that the stout , middle-aged man was telling a joke to his young comrade , who was tall and of athletic build . Now and again they would steal a glance at Mr. Chiu 's table . <p> The air smelled of rotten melon . A few flies kept buzzing above the couple 's lunch . Hundreds of people were rushing around to get on the platform or to catch buses to downtown . Food and fruit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dozen young women , representing the local hotels , held up placards which displayed the daily prices and words as large as a palm , like Free Meals , Air-Conditioning , and On the River . In the center of the square stood a concrete statue of Chairman Mao , at whose feet peasants were napping with their backs on the warm granite and with their faces toward the sunny sky . A flock of pigeons perched on the chairman 's raised hand and forearm . <p> The rice and cucumber tasted good and Mr. Chiu was eating unhurriedly . His sallow face showed exhaustion . He was glad that the honeymoon was finally over and that he and his bride were heading for Harbin . During the two weeks ' vacation , he had been worried about his liver because three months ago he had suffered from acute hepatitis ; he was afraid he might have a relapse . But there had been no severe symptom , despite his liver being still big and tender . On the whole he was pleased with his health , which could even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on the course of recovery . He looked at his bride , who took off her wire glasses , kneading the root of her nose with her fingertips . Beads of sweat coated her pale cheeks . <p> " Are you all right , sweetheart ? " he asked . " I have a headache . I did n't sleep well last night . " " Take an aspirin , will you ? " <p> " It 's not that serious . Tomorrow is Sunday and I can sleep longer . Do n't worry . " <p> As they were talking , the stout policeman at the next table stood up and threw a bowl of tea in their direction . Both Mr. Chiu 's and his bride 's sandals were wet instantly . " Hooligan ! " she said in a low voice . Mr. Chiu got to his feet and said out loud , " Comrade policeman , why did you do this ? " He stretched out his right foot to show the wet sandal . <p> " Do what ? " the stout man asked huskily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whistling . " See , you dumped water on our feet . " " You 're lying . You wet your shoes yourself . " " Comrade policeman , your duty is to keep order , but you purposely tortured us common citizens . Why violate the law you are supposed to enforce ? " As Mr. Chiu was speaking , dozens of people began gathering around . <p> With a wave of his hand , the man said to the young fellow , " Let 's get hold of him ! " <p> They grabbed Mr. Chiu and clamped handcuffs around his wrists . He cried , " You ca n't do this to me . This is utterly unreasonable . " <p> " Shut up ! " The man pulled out his pistol . " You can use your tongue at our headquarters . " <p> The young fellow added , " You 're a saboteur , you know ? You 're disrupting public order . " <p> The bride was too terrified to say anything coherent . She was a recent college graduate , had majored in fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrest . All she could say now was , " Oh please , please ! " <p> The policemen were pulling Mr. Chiu , but he refused to go with them , holding the corner of the table and shouting , " We have a train to catch . We already bought the tickets . " <p> The stout man punched him in the chest . " Shut up . Let your ticket expire . " With the pistol butt he chopped Mr. Chiu 's hands , which at once released the table . Together the two men were dragging him away to the police station . <p> Realizing he had to go with them , Mr. Chiu turned his head and shouted to his bride , " Do n't wait for me here . Take the train . If I 'm not back by tomorrow morning , send someone over to get me out . " She nodded , covering her sobbing mouth with her palm . After removing his shoelaces , they locked Mr. Chiu into a cell in the back of the Railroad Police Station . The single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it faced a spacious yard in which stood a few pines . Beyond the trees two swings hung from an iron frame , swaying gently in the breeze . Somewhere in the building a cleaver was chopping rhythmically . There must be a kitchen upstairs , Mr. Chiu thought . <p> He was too exhausted to worry about what they would do to him , so he lay down on the narrow bed , with his eyes shut . He was n't afraid . The Cultural Revolution was over already , and recently the Party had been propagating the idea that all citizens were equal before the law . The police ought to be a law-abiding model for common people . As long as he remained coolheaded and reasoned with them , they might not harm him . <p> Late in the afternoon he was taken to the Interrogation Bureau on the second floor . On his way there , in the stairwell , he ran into the middle-aged policeman who had manhandled him . The man grinned , rolling his bulgy eyes and pointing his fingers at him like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chiu cursed mentally . <p> The moment he sat down in the office , he burped , his palm shielding his mouth . In front of him , across a long desk , sat the chief of the bureau and a donkey-faced man . On the glass desktop was a folder containing information on his case . He felt it bizarre that in just a matter of hours they had accumulated a small pile of writing about him . On second thought he began to wonder whether they had kept a file on him all the time . How could this have happened ? He lived and worked in Harbin , more than three hundred miles away , and this was his first time in Muji City . The chief of the bureau was a thin , bald man , who looked serene and intelligent . His slim hands handled the written pages in the folder like those of a lecturing scholar . To Mr. Chiu 's left sat a young scribe , with a clipboard on his knee and a black fountain pen in his hand . <p> " Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question from a form . " Chiu Maguang . " " Age ? " <p> " Thirty-four . " " Profession ? " " Lecturer . " " Work unit ? " " Harbin University . " " Political status ? " " Communist Party member . " <p> The chief put down the paper and began to speak . " Your crime is sabotage , although it has n't induced serious consequences yet . Because you are a Party member , you should be punished more . You have failed to be a model for the masses and you- " " Excuse me , sir , " Mr. Chiu cut him off . " What ? " <p> " I did n't do anything . Your men are the saboteurs of our social order . They threw hot tea on my feet and my wife 's feet . Logically speaking , you should criticize them , if not punish them . " " That statement is groundless . You have no witness . How could I believe you ? " the chief said matter-of-factly . " This is my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your man hit my fingers with a pistol . " <p> " That ca n't prove how your feet got wet . Besides , you could hurt your fingers by yourself . " <p> " But I told the truth ! " Anger flared up in Mr. Chiu . " Your police station owes me an apology . My train ticket has expired , my new leather sandals are ruined , and I am late for a conference in the provincial capital . You must compensate me for the damage and losses . Do n't mistake me for a common citizen who would tremble when you sneeze . I 'm a scholar , a philosopher , and an expert in dialectical materialism . If necessary , we will argue about this in the Northeastern Daily , or we will go to the highest People 's Court in Beijing . Tell me , what 's your name ? " He got carried away by his harangue , which was by no means trivial and had worked to his advantage on numerous occasions . <p> " Stop bluffing us , " the donkey-faced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your kind . We can easily prove you are guilty . Here are some of the statements given by the eyewitnesses . " He pushed a few sheets of paper toward Mr. Chiu . <p> Mr. Chiu was dazed to see the different handwritings , which all stated that he had shouted in the square to attract attention and refused to obey the police . One of the witnesses had identified herself as a purchasing agent from a shipyard in Shanghai . Something stirred in Mr. Chiu 's stomach , a pain rising to his ribs . He gave out a faint moan . <p> " Now , you have to admit you are guilty , " the chief said . " Although it 's a serious crime , we wo n't punish you severely , provided you write out a self-criticism and promise that you wo n't disrupt public order again . In other words , whether you will be released will depend on your attitude toward this crime . " " You 're daydreaming , " Mr. Chiu cried . " I wo n't write a word , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me with a letter of apology so I can explain to my university why I 'm late . " <p> Both the interrogators smiled with contempt . " Well , we 've never done that , " said the chief , taking a puff at his cigarette . " Then make this a precedent . " <p> " It 's unnecessary . We are pretty certain that you will comply with our wishes . " The chief blew a column of smoke at Mr. Chiu 's face . <p> At the tilt of the chief 's head , two guards stepped forward and grabbed the criminal by the arms . Mr. Chiu meanwhile went on saying , " I shall report you to the provincial administration . You 'll have to pay for this ! You are worse than the Japanese military police . " <p> They dragged him out of the room . <p> After dinner , which consisted of a bowl of millet porridge , a corn bun , and a piece of pickled turnip , Mr. Chiu began to have a fever , shaking with a chill and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had got into his liver and that he was probably having a relapse . No medicine was available , because his briefcase had been left with his bride . At home it would have been time for him to sit in front of their color TV , drinking jasmine tea and watching the evening news . It was so lonesome in here . The orange bulb above the single bed was the only source of light , which enabled the guards to keep him under surveillance at night . A moment ago he had asked them for a newspaper or a magazine to read , but they had turned him down . <p> Through the small opening on the door noises came in . It seemed that the police on duty were playing poker or chess in a nearby office ; shouts and laughter could be heard now and then . Meanwhile , an accordion kept coughing from a remote corner in the building . Looking at the ballpoint and the letter paper left for him by the guards when they took him back from the Interrogation Bureau , Mr. Chiu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into soldiers , the more he argues , the muddier his point becomes . " How ridiculous this whole thing was . He ruffled his thick hair with his fingers . <p> He felt miserable , massaging his stomach continually . To tell the truth , he was more upset than frightened , because he would have to catch up with his work once he was back home-a paper that was to meet the publishing deadline next week , and two dozen books he ought to read for the courses he was going to teach in the fall . <p> A human shadow flitted across the opening . Mr. Chiu rushed to the door and shouted through the hole , " Comrade guard , comrade guard ! " <p> " What do you want ? " a voice rasped . <p> " I want you to inform your leaders that I 'm very sick . I have heart disease and hepatitis . I may die here if you keep me like this without medication . " <p> " No leader is on duty on the weekend . You have to wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll stay in here tomorrow ? " " Yes . " <p> " Your station will be held responsible if anything happens to me . " " We know that . Take it easy , you wo n't die . " It seemed illogical that Mr. Chiu slept quite well that night , though the light above his head had been on all the time , and the straw mattress was hard and infested with fleas . He was afraid of ticks , mosquitoes , cockroaches-any kind of insect but fleas and bedbugs . Once in the countryside , where his school 's faculty and staff had helped the peasants harvest crops for a week , his colleagues had joked about his flesh , which they said must have tasted nonhuman to fleas . Except for him , they were all afflicted with hundreds of bites . <p> More amazing now , he felt he did n't miss his bride a lot . He even enjoyed sleeping alone , perhaps because the honeymoon had tired him out and he needed more rest . The back yard was quiet on Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A few sparrows were jumping on the ground , catching caterpillars and ladybugs . Holding the steel bars , Mr. Chiu inhaled the morning air , which smelled meaty . There must be a restaurant or a delicatessen nearby . He reminded himself that he should take this detention with ease . A sentence that Chairman Mao had written to a hospitalized friend rose in his mind : " Since you are already in here , you may as well stay and make the best of it . " <p> His desire for peace of mind originated from his fear that his hepatitis might get worse . He tried to remain unperturbed . However , he was sure that his liver was swelling up , since the fever still persisted . For a whole day he lay in bed , thinking about his paper on the nature of contradictions . Time and again he was overwhelmed by anger , cursing aloud , " A bunch of thugs ! " He swore that once he was out , he would write an article about this experience . He had better find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to be a restful day for the most part ; he was certain that his university would send somebody to his rescue . All he should do now was remain calm and wait patiently . Sooner or later the police would have to release him , although they had no idea that he might refuse to leave unless they wrote him an apology . Damn those hoodlums , they had ordered more than they could eat ! When he woke up on Monday morning , it was already light . Somewhere a man was moaning ; the sound came from the back yard . After a long yawn , and kicking off the tattered blanket , Mr. Chiu climbed out of bed and went to the window . In the middle of the yard , a young man was fastened to a pine , his wrists handcuffed from behind around the trunk . He was wriggling and swearing loudly , but there was no sign of anyone else in the yard . He looked familiar to Mr. Chiu . <p> Mr. Chiu squinted his eyes to see who it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was Fenjin , a recent graduate from the Law Department at Harbin University . Two years ago Mr. Chiu had taught a course in Marxist materialism , in which Fenjin had been enrolled . Now , how on earth had this young devil landed here ? <p> Then it dawned on him that Fenjin must have been sent over by his bride . What a stupid woman ! What a bookworm , who knew only how to read foreign novels . He had expected that she would talk to the school 's security section , which would for sure send a cadre here . Fenjin held no official position ; he merely worked in a private law firm that had just two lawyers ; in fact , they had little business except for some detective work for men and women who suspected their spouses of having extramarital affairs . Mr. Chiu was overcome with a wave of nausea . <p> Should he call out to let his student know he was nearby ? He decided not to , because he did n't know what had happened . Fenjin must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet , this would not have occurred if Fenjin had n't come to his rescue . So no matter what , Mr. Chiu had to do something . But what could he do ? It was going to be a scorcher . He could see purple steam shimmering and rising from the ground among the pines . Poor devil , he thought , as he raised a bowl of corn glue to his mouth , sipped , and took a bite of a piece of salted celery . When a guard came to collect the bowl and the chopsticks , Mr. Chiu asked him what had happened to the man in the back yard . " He called our boss bandit , " ' the guard said . " He claimed he was a lawyer or something . An arrogant son of a rabbit . " <p> Now it was obvious that Mr. Chiu had to do something to help his rescuer . Before he could figure out a way , a scream broke out in the back yard . He rushed to the window and saw a tall policeman standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was the same young fellow who had arrested Mr. Chiu in the square two days before . The man pinched Fenjin 's nose , then raised his hand , which stayed in the air for a few seconds , then slapped the lawyer across the face . As Fenjin was groaning , the man lifted up the bucket and poured the water on his head . <p> " This will keep you from getting sunstroke , boy . I 'll give you some more every hour , " the man said loudly . Fenjin kept his eyes shut , yet his wry face showed that he was struggling to hold back from cursing the policeman or that he was probably sobbing in silence . He sneezed , then raised his face and shouted , " Let me go take a piss . " " Oh yeah ? " the man bawled . " Pee in your pants . " Still Mr. Chiu did n't make any noise , holding the steel bars with both hands , his fingers white . The policeman turned and glanced at the cell 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun . With a snort he spat his cigarette butt to the ground and stamped it into the dust . <p> Then the door opened and the guards motioned Mr. Chiu to come out . Again they took him upstairs to the Interrogation Bureau . The same men were in the office , though this time the scribe was sitting there empty-handed . At the sight of Mr. Chiu the chief said , " Ah , here you are . Please be seated . " <p> After Mr. Chiu sat down , the chief waved a white silk fan and said to him , " You may have seen your lawyer . He 's a young man without manners , so our director had him taught a crash lesson in the back yard . " <p> " It 's illegal to do that . Are n't you afraid to appear in a newspaper ? " " No , we are not , not even on TV . What else can you do ? We are not afraid of any story you make up . We call it fiction . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's to say , you must admit your crime . " <p> " What if I refuse to cooperate ? " <p> " Then your lawyer will continue his education in the sunshine . " A swoon swayed Mr. Chiu , and he held the arms of the chair to steady himself . A numb pain stung him in the upper stomach and nauseated him , and his head was throbbing . He was sure that the hepatitis was finally attacking him . Anger was flaming up in his chest , his throat was tight and clogged . <p> The chief resumed , " As a matter of fact , you do n't have to write out your self-criticism . We had your crime described clearly here . What we need is just your signature . " Holding back his rage , Mr. Chiu said , " Let me look at that . " With a smirk the donkey-faced man handed him a sheet , which carried these words : " I hereby admit that on July 13 I disrupted public order at Muji Train Station , and that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their warning . Thus I myself am responsible for my arrest . After two days ' detention , I have realized the reactionary nature of my crime . From now on , I shall continue to educate myself with all my effort and shall never commit this kind of crime again . " <p> A voice started screaming in Mr. Chiu 's head , " Lie , lie ! " But he shook his head and forced the voice away . He asked the chief , " If I sign this , will you release both my lawyer and me ? " " Of course , we 'll do that . " The chief was drumming his fingers on the blue folder-their file on him . Mr. Chiu signed his name and put his thumbprint under his signature . <p> " Now you are free to go , " the chief said with a smile , and handed him a piece of paper to wipe his thumb with . Mr. Chiu was so sick that he did n't stand up from the chair at the first try . Then he doubled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the building to meet his lawyer in the back yard . In his chest he felt as though there were a bomb . If he were able to , he would have razed the entire police station and eliminated all their families . Though he knew he could do nothing like that , he made up his mind to do something . " Sorry about this torture , Fenjin , " Mr. Chiu said when they met . " It does n't matter . They are savages . " The lawyer brushed a patch of dirt off his jacket with his trembling fingers . Water was still dribbling from the bottoms of his trouser legs . " Let 's go now , " the teacher said . <p> The moment they came out of the police station , Mr. Chiu caught sight of a tea stand . He grabbed Fenjin ' s arm and walked over to the old woman at the table . " Two bowls of black tea , " he said and handed her a one-yuan note . <p> After the first bowl , they each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train station . But before they walked fifty yards , Mr. Chiu insisted on eating a bowl of tree-ear soup at a food stand . Fenjin agreed . He told his teacher , " Do n't treat me like a guest . " " No , I want to eat something myself . " As if dying of hunger , Mr. Chiu dragged his lawyer from restaurant to restaurant near the police station , but at each place he ordered no more than two bowls of food . Fenjin wondered why his teacher would n't stay at one place and eat his fill . <p> Mr. Chiu bought noodles , wonton , eight-grain porridge , and chicken soup , respectively , at four restaurants . While eating , he kept saying through his teeth , " If only I could kill all the bastards ! " At the last place he merely took a few sips of the soup without tasting the chicken cubes and mushrooms . <p> Fenjin was baffled by his teacher , who looked ferocious and muttered to himself mysteriously , and whose jaundiced face was covered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Chiu as an ugly man . <p> Within a month over eight hundred people contracted acute hepatitis in Muji . Six died of the disease , including two children . Nobody knew how the epidemic had started . <p> 
##1003651 1 . The Missionary <p> Hortense Ritter was tired of bridge , of gossipy lunches , of tapping a wooden ball with a mallet to make it roll through wire wickets in competition with friends . She found no companionship in chasing a little white spot around a green , and few of her friends went any more to the zocalo for morning coffee and a chat . Occasionally from a table at the Universal or at Los Arcos she struck up a conversation with American tourists , but she was careful about making friends with strangers , no matter how entertaining she might find new people to be . And she often did . She liked learning what others thought about , how they earned their living , where they grew up , where they lived now , what sort of families they had , what they did for amusement , and she was good at it . People opened up to her , but she tried not to take risks . On days when she was especially restless , like this morning , she sometimes poked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for American women doing good in Cuernavaca . She felt safe there . <p> When she arrived about noon on this particular day , the first thing she saw was an old woman dozing upright on a narrow highback wooden chair just inside the entryway . The faded canvas purse that rested on the woman 's slanting lap between loosely clasped hands and an ample stomach looked as though it might break through the slack dam of fingers and thud against the dark tile floor . Conflicting images contended in Hortense 's mind . First she thought the woman looked like a bag of potatoes someone had left on the chair ; and then it occurred to her that the chair was like a throne on which an aged princess of a moribund dynasty sat . She went over to a friend who was in charge of the cash drawer that day and asked in a low , well modulated voice , " Who is the old dear over there on that impossible chair ? " <p> The friend fished up a copy of a receipt with the name Clara Sample @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cookies and carrot cakes to be sold . She was a Presbyterian missionary , the friend said , who taught catechism to young girls and also showed them how to make a little money baking . She had walked to the guild house . <p> " Walked ! " Hortense said , trying to keep her voice down . " She must be in her eighties . " <p> Her friend nodded and whispered , " At least . " <p> As it was her cook 's day off , Hortense had come to the guild thinking she might buy a frozen quiche to heat up for lunch . Her other servant could eat his usual tortillas and chile-spiked substances , but she needed something easier on her stomach . She decided to buy an extra quiche and then try to lure Clara Sample to her house . Prepared to catch the purse should it fall , she stood by the throne-like chair , leaned over , and said , " Mrs. Sample . " <p> Clara woke abruptly . One of her hands grasped the purse , and the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green print cotton dress . " What ? You want my mother ? " <p> " It 's you I want , Mrs. Sample . I 'm Hortense Ritter . " <p> " My mother was Mrs. Sample , God rest her soul . I 'm Clara . " She had risen to her feet and was not much taller standing than she had been seated . She was squat with large arms thick with bags of flesh . <p> " It 's a pleasure to meet you . I 'm Hortense , " Hortense repeated in a loud voice , in case her new acquaintance was deaf . " I was to have lunch alone today , but I was wondering if you would do me the favor of coming to my house to share the meal with me . It 'll be very simple , I 'm afraid . " <p> " Oh , how kind ! " A broad smile exposed yellowed enamel patched with amalgam . " Simple fare is what I like . " <p> In the car as she drove , Hortense found out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her widowed mother to work as a Presbyterian missionary and intended to work " in the Lord 's vineyard , " as she said , until her last breath . " God willing , " she added . Then she rattled off , like a recitation , that she had a room with a family of Presbyterians and worked in their church , not the church that caters to the rich Mexicans on Abasolo Street , but the old one catty-corner from the Latino-Americana aparment house . " You must have noticed it , " she said . <p> Hortense had often seen the church , which overlooked a small raised plaza shaded by tall trees , and had wondered what sort of people went there . All Mexicans , she had judged from the building 's plainness . She was about to ask if many Americans attended services , but had arrived at her house and honked the horn for the boy to open the garage door . She felt guiltier than usual about making such a public racket . With a faint smile she said , " When in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Clara said in what seemed to be agreement . <p> Hortense led her guest to the long porch next to the garden and showed her a room where she could freshen up . " I 'll leave you a few minutes . I have to take the quiches to the kitchen . " <p> When Hortense came back she expected to find Clara seated comfortably on the porch , but she was n't there . Hortense looked into the bedroom she had indicated and found the old woman sitting on a straight chair in the half-light , perhaps dozing or maybe gazing at the wall . " Miss Sample ? Clara ? Are you all right ? " <p> Clara sprang to her feet , surprisingly spry . " I was just looking at that clock there . Thinking about it . " <p> " Oh . The digital clock . " <p> " I prefer the round kind that shows where it 's coming from and where it 's going . It gives a person confidence that life goes on . I find this one apocalyptic . It puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red numbers . All the counting that comes at the end of things . " Clara waited for a response , but Hortense was at a loss . Then Clara said , " Do n't you think ? " <p> " Why , Clara , " Hortense said , " what a lovely accent you have . So soft . Do come out into the light and air and have some mango juice . " <p> They sat facing the narrow garden . The houseboy brought iced glasses . " Lovely , " Clara said . <p> " Now let me guess . You come from Alabama . " <p> " I was born and bred in Wendell , Georgia . That 's south Georgia . Lived there all my life until Mother and I came to Mexico . I taught English in the local school . This mango juice is delicious . " Clara looked across the green lawn at a fountain set into an ivy-covered wall , water gushing from a lion 's mouth . Her lips moved , speaking to someone not present . Then she said aloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shade , " and fixed her flat brown eyes on Hortense ' s blue ones . <p> " Yes , Clara . " Hortense was solemn now . <p> " It was how we lived in Wendell . Mexico was quite a shock to Mother and me . Nothing like this . " <p> " I can imagine . " <p> " Can you ? " Clara 's flesh firmed up slightly , and she leaned forward . " Can you imagine the missionary life in remote places where everybody ' s poor , living hand to mouth ? Nothing much in the way of stores . No electricity . No running water . Houses with palmleaf roofs . We got used to sleeping on stick beds or hard floors as we traveled from mission to mission , but we became flexible . If you 're flexible , change does n't hurt . " She relaxed and settled farther into her chair . <p> " I prepared myself for the missionary work , you know . My father was the pastor of our Presbyterian church in Wendell . After his death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in the end the authorities would n't certify me , and the church would n't send me . So Mother and I came on our own . " <p> " That was very brave of you . " <p> " Yes . " <p> " We 're almost ready for lunch . " <p> " It was brave of Mother . She had allowed herself to get stout over the years and had never been very active . Physically . Walking was hard on her in those mountain places . She was always short of breath . And she never lost weight . Whatever happened she never changed . It may sound unkind of me to say this , but I say it with love : Mother looked like a sack of potatoes . " <p> It had been decades since Hortense had blushed . It had n't seemed likely that she would ever blush again , but now her pale skin became hot and was suffused with red . Words hid from her . Like slipping buttons into button-holes , Clara fastened her eyes onto Hortense ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look a lot like Mother . " <p> Hortense got up and reached for the silver bell on the round table set for lunch . She shook the bell as if ringing for her life and stopped only when the houseboy appeared in the kitchen door . 2 . Slave Bells <p> When I was a girl in Wendell-a young woman , they would say now-I was so isolated , not being allowed to work and the female society there so restricted , the girls I grew up with married or moved away . And no male society to speak of . Just Father-who was president of the local bank and was gone most of the day-and a few relatives and occasionally meeting someone outside the family circle at church or at big events like weddings or funerals . Or little events , like people doing jobs at the house . Electricians , plumbers , seamstresses . Especially an electrician . <p> I used to get so lonely . We had these slave bells left over from times past , silver bells for calling servants . We had maybe half a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the house . We had bells but not much in the way of servants . Mother did most of the cooking . I got so lonely . Sometimes when Mother was busy in the kitchen and could n't hear , I 'd take the bells out to the side porch and ring them , ring them furiously . Not a leaf stirred in the oleanders or in the crepe myrtles or in the oaks . Not a bird interrupted its song . No one ever came , but the bells were company . <p> Then one day an electrician came to install an electric doorbell at the front . He was young , the son of the old electrician who used to come to the house . He liked me , and I liked him . <p> I was two months pregnant , and no one knew it until Mother figured it out , and then no one knew but Mother and me . I 'll always wonder whether the young man who caused my child would have wanted to marry me . <p> Mother told Father we were going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was get in the car and drive to Mexico . It was before the war , when Roosevelt was promoting the Pan-American Union and a good highway was being built to Central America . <p> If people had known what we did , they would have thought we were crazy , two women driving alone to Monterrey , 150 miles south of the border . All through the South . Down through Texas . All that way . We were n't crazy . People were crazy . Society was crazy . Imagine having to do such a thing ! Father was crazy . The Presbyterian preacher . The president of the bank . The maker and mirror of public opinion . Crazy . <p> We were befriended . First by the doctor , then by his wife . We told them that my husband had been killed in an automobile accident during our wedding trip . I was sad enough , disturbed enough , for them to believe it . <p> By then , of course , Father knew . He and Mother had one long , painful telephone conversation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black phone close to her face , as though someone could hear us in another room . I lay on the bed and studied the pattern of shadows on the ceiling above the fan . Slowly it turned like a wheel in nature 's clock . There was nothing Father could do but wire us money . <p> Mother became merry , desperately merry . The doctor 's wife joined in , and the doctor himself was kind , gentle . Mother and I attended services at the Presbyterian church , not that we understood anything that was said . Our friends there took pleasure in being kind to us . Their example taught me to care for strangers . From then on that 's all I 've wanted to do . <p> I no longer remember with any clarity the last month or so before the baby arrived ; nor do I remember at all the day it was born . The doctor had made arrangements for placing it . The day I left the hospital we checked out of the hotel and headed for Wendell , but by then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . Father was cold to me , and my home was where the baby was . The bells rang in Mexico . <p> 3 . Lunch <p> As Hortense put the bell back onto the table and Clara came out of her sudden , silent memory , the houseboy appeared with bowls of vichyssoise . " Clara , " Hortense said as melodiously as she could , " we have a little cold soup the cook left us . " <p> " How very nice , " Clara said , taking her place at the table . <p> The houseboy brought a bottle wrapped in a cloth . " Would you like a little wine , Clara ? " Hortense said . " You do n't disapprove of wine do you ? " <p> " Me ? Who am I to disapprove ? No indeed . After all , I toil in the vineyard of the Lord , as it were . But I wo n't have any , thank you . " She turned her glass upside down . " Just a little water please . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico . " <p> " It would seem dull to many . " Clara looked out to the treeshaded garden and up the length of the porch . " All lives are interesting though . You must have a good one . " <p> " Good ? " Hortense smiled and then frowned . <p> " You certainly are very good to ask me to lunch . This delicious potato soup . I wonder what I can do for you . " <p> " Do for me ! There 's no need to do for me . " <p> Clara 's glance swept over the table , the silver , the crystal , the linen , the flowers . " It 's true that you seem well provided for . Do you have family here ? " <p> " I 'm a widow . My children and grandchildren-all growncome from time to time . They love it here . I have many friends . " <p> " How fortunate . " <p> " We play a lot of bridge . Some croquet . People visit from the States and Canada and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on long trips once or twice a year . It 's a pleasant life . " <p> At first , after Hortense had spoken and while they ate the vichyssoise and then the quiche and then a green salad , Clara was silent , absorbed by thought , but after a bit she linked silences with talk guiding Hortense through scenes from missionary life . Mountain villages from Monterrey to Oaxaca . Children in her care . One child after another born in poverty . First she mentioned only babies but then children steadily older . She spoke of the grave of Mrs. Sample in Cuernavaca . Churches . Cakes and cookies . Catechism . As though Clara controlled her hostess 's mouth with marionette strings , Hortense smiled and was solemn and smiled and was solemn . Rang the bell . Directed the houseboy . Offered bread . <p> Hortense had begged off a game of bridge for the afternoon . She thought she had been playing too much lately . She had taken to dreaming of hearts and diamonds defending themselves against spades and clubs . But now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yearned for the game and her old friends North , East , South , and West . Over dessert of melon balls , of watermelon , cantaloupe , and honeydew , she began to feel drowsy . In recent years toward the end of lunch the talk of her companions often hypnotized her and caused her eyes to glaze over and eventually close as she sat upright embalmed by nouns , verbs , adverbs , and adjectives . Today , in an effort to keep awake , she tried to concentrate on something away from the table , first on the huge philodendron across the garden and then the pattern of shadows of tree limbs and leaves on the lawn . But this became confused with red and green leaves repeated on the white cotton fabric of Clara 's dress and trapped Hortense in its web the same way it seemed to hinder the black magpie picking a path through the grass . <p> Hortense lost her struggle to keep alert when Clara embarked on the subject of dreams . The drone was invincible . " To me , " Clara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One must respect , as with all else , vows and promises , one 's own and those of others . Which is why I make so few . But the problem is that a quarter to a third of one 's life is spent asleep , and when asleep a person is capable of the most shocking behavior . Night before last , for example , I was a young woman without conscience conducting a sexual affair with a married man , someone I had never laid eyes on in my waking life . When I woke , I was appalled . How could someone like myself dream such a thing ? But then I assume everybody has these dreams , would n't you say ? " <p> Hortense 's head drooped forward . She pulled it up with a spasm , a spasm similar to those that bodies sometimes have after death , but it drooped again and settled undisturbed , her chin resting on the bone running from shoulder to shoulder . <p> " I 'm worried , " Clara said . " Worried that now I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Suppose my dream self gets pregnant . What then ? My lover would never divorce his wife . I would have to go through those months of morning sickness in my night dreams and eventually give birth to a dream baby . How would I protect it from the judgment of Wendell , where my dreams are spun ? What nightmares may be in store for me and for the baby as it grows up ? Will I abandon it , as so many have been abandoned by so many ? What will I have to do to atone ? " <p> Clara observed , when she paused , that Hortense was now so sealed off inside herself that her eyelids moved rapidly in dreams of her own , her breathing deep , slow , regular . It was then , when Hortense was in her most receptive state , that Clara thought it appropriate to speak further of atonement . <p> In every life she had come to know in depth , she said , good people had committed injustices and had failed in their obligations to others It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had learned that it had to be true in all others . " I do n't judge , " she said . " How could I ? This flaw in people is part and parcel of their humanity . And I have found that making up for the flaw-this is what atonement is-brings the deepest satisfaction to be had in life . " <p> Another black magpie swept down onto the sunlit lawn and interrupted Clara as it cracked the complaint basic to its nature and set about searching with its beak for nourishment in the grass . The day had reached that stage when shadows repented their earlier retreat into the objects that had cast them , and now they leaked out from another side to creep toward twilight . Clara joined the postmeridian hush . Such peace , she thought . And then she thought : Peace is in the grave . <p> She leaned over and murmured into Hortense 's ear . " You have a happy life , prosperity , dear friends and family . So why did you pluck me up out of the guild house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your entertainment ? Or do you grope for something significant ? If that 's it , be careful . You may find a pastime with greater meaning than you bargain for . <p> " If you sense that you 're someone meant to be of greater use to others than you are now , let me tell you that nothing is more important than being who you really are . Live your life to the fullest . Use to the hilt your natural gift for being kind to strangers . Study kindness . Use it all day long . Someday the Lord will come and say , What did you do with your gift ? ' If you do n't use it , it 'll be taken away . " <p> Clara watched Hortense 's still face and deep breathing for a minute or so and then , careful not to scrape the chair against the floor , got up and made her way to the street silently . She left without the houseboy 's knowing until the noise of the front door closing brought him to the porch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door slammed , Hortense reached automatically for the bell but stopped short of ringing it when she saw the houseboy trotting to the entry . After a quick search of the house she had to accept that Clara had simply got up and had walked away without a word . But why ? <p> Hortense 's first impulse was to go to the street and look for her . But would Clara have walked toward the center of town or away from it ? Or perhaps she would have gone east or west . Hortense did n't yet feel fully alert ; she did n't feel physically up to walking through the streets in the sun . She decided to take a nap and then think more clearly about Clara . <p> When she woke an hour or so later and was still lying on the bed staring at the wall , she remembered Clara 's big brown purse . She was sure Clara did n't have it with her in the house . She got up and went to the garage and found the purse on the front seat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her tea to the porch before opening the purse . She was reluctant to violate another 's privacy , but she did anyway . The purse was empty . Not even a receipt for cookies and cakes . It hardly seemed worth the bother to return it . Yet Hortense did n't want it in the house , and she did n't want to give it away , and she did n't want to throw it out . She felt compelled beyond logic to find Clara . <p> The next morning , carrying the purse with her , her own smaller one inside , she walked to the church Clara had mentioned . A simple two-story building with several gothic-arched windows , it faced a small public square shaded by tall ficus trees . The plaza was at the intersection of two major traffic arteries traveled by a continuous stream of buses and taxis . Men who shined shoes had their canopied stands set up there , and so did vendors of nuts and brightly colored flavored waters . A rough pavement was a landing field for pigeons and a playground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were no benches ; so Hortense sat on a step leading to a terrace dominated by a large statue of a fat-faced smiling mother clasping an infant to her bosom . <p> Hortense wondered what she would do next . Outside of private houses she was used to coping only in markets , shops , restaurants , professional offices , and theaters , all places prepared to receive the public . She gazed at the church . It had a patio to one side closed off from the plaza by an iron gate , which had been left slightly open . An Indian woman dressed in layers of brilliantly colored skirts came out , a baby like a stone in a slingshot hanging in a rebozo from her shoulder . Moments later a leather-faced woman in a dress of the same red and green leaf pattern Clara had worn stepped onto the plaza from the patio and closed the gate . <p> Conscious of her limited Spanish and hesitant to approach a stranger who did n't know English , Hortense walked a few paces behind the woman , not knowing what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buses picked up south-bound passengers , and Hortense followed the red , white , and green dress onto a bus marked " Polvorin . " She gave the driver a coin of the same denomination as the one she saw the woman give and then sat several seats behind her , hoping not to draw attention to herself , although her broadstriped blouse and straw hat with its wide brim turned down to protect her fair skin from the tropic sun were sure to be noticed by other passengers . <p> Near the Acapulco highway the bus plowed across busy traffic lanes to enter a street that passed between a number of mined-out quarries , a series of large , deep craters in the mountainside . The woman in what looked to be Clara Sample 's dress left her seat and stood by the door to wait for the bus to stop . When the dress disappeared down the steps , Hortense rushed up the aisle in pursuit . Other passengers got off after her and scattered in various directions . She saw the leaf print glide past the blank white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . <p> The woman turned right at the corner , and Hortense almost ran the length of the block , slowing as she turned into the graveled street to follow half a block behind until the woman went off to the right . When Hortense reached the corner , she could n't see the woman and so quickened her steps to a place where the street ended in a steep descent into a worked-out pit . The woman was already on the floor of the quarry and was walking toward a hovel made of corrugated cardboard . At its entrance she hesitated briefly and looked back as if to make sure that Hortense was following her . <p> Hortense slipped repeatedly on the loosened pebbles and dirt as she picked her way down the trail on slick leather soles and heels . At the bottom she paused and rested . She took off her hat for a moment and opened Clara 's bag and then her own to get a Kleenex with which to pat her brow . Straight ahead , high up , she noticed speeding cars on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escarpment , looming like a tall faceless building , cast shade for which she was grateful . The hut was in that shade several yards ahead . <p> The hut had neither door nor windows , only an opening where Hortense had to wait for her eyes to accustom themselves to the dark inside . She was surprised by the sweet , rather pleasant odor of the airless space . Gradually she made out the bright red , green , and white of the dress moving about . Across the room from it a voice said , " Come on in . " <p> " Clara ? Is that you ? " <p> " Come in . " <p> " You left your purse . " <p> " I wanted you to have it . I ca n't fill it any more . Maybe you can . " The room no longer seemed dark , and Hortense was now able to see . She said , " I 'm not sure I know what you mean . " <p> Clara was standing near a bed . " Come over here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pale , feverish girl lay there and blinked as Hortense came near . " Carmen 's sick . Her mother works in Mexico City . Her grandmother-the woman you followed here-takes care of her and her brothers as best she can between odd jobs . " <p> The woman interrupted , speaking so rapidly that Hortense could n't make out a word . Clara turned her attention to the hurried statement until the woman said , " Con permiso , " and left . <p> Clara said , " A brother of Carmen's-just four months old-is in the civil hospital with diarrhea . He wo n't live , most likely . The older brothers are on the street running wild . " She went to the doorway and stood in it looking out . " I 'm getting too weak for all this . Weak everywhere . Behind the eyes . " She took a few steps outside and turned around , more than ever the image of a sack of potatoes . Her dress was brown like the purse and loose-hanging and made her skin seem sallow . " Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length of the escarpment . Gray huts Hortense had n't noticed before appeared to have grown out of the gray cliff . A few children and a woman walked toward huts even farther away . " They do n't help each other , these people , " Clara said . " They help their own , their own kin , but not strangers living next door . A few even prey on the others . Yet I can introduce you to women among them who are as eloquent as the president of the republic . " <p> " I suppose it 's the culture . " <p> " Centuries of it . A high culture . Two high cultures . Three . The conquering , the conquered , and now ours seeping in . " <p> " I would n't think of interfering . " <p> " You would n't ? I 've interfered most of my life . And so have others to the benefit of us all . In the city where I lived before , I begged people in my church and other people too for building materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the squatters I was helping how to get electric and water services , and I found a lawyer to help them get title to the land they built on . If you have the energy to do all that , nothing on this earth makes you feel better . But I no longer have it in me . Please take off your hat . " " What ? " <p> " I ca n't see your face . Your thoughts . Please do n't hide them . I want to see what you think when I tell you that my energy is drying up . The Lord has put me under a dry sponge and is sucking my spirit into it . I 'm desperate for these people . They are needing help , but I 'm no longer fit for new work . " <p> Hortense took her hat off , shook out her hair , and patted her forehead with a Kleenex . As she brought her arm down , it hit some wind chimes Clara must have hung at one side of the doorway . They had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice from inside the hut called , " Dona Clara . " <p> " Little Carmen hears the chimes , " Clara said . " Voy , hijita . " <p> Hortense stepped back to let Clara pass and with her hat in her hand looked up the steep road leading out of the pit . It occurred to her that she still had Clara 's handbag and her own in it . She glanced at the escarpment . It pressed dark shade down upon her . Inside the hut Carmen whimpered , and farther off a man spoke in an angry voice . Hortense 's elbows burrowed into her sides , and she shivered as she walked to where the road led up and out . <p> She bent forward , struggling to ascend , her slick soles slipping against the hard , dry earth . She fell onto her knees as the big purse and her hat dropped and her hands reached out to stop her fall . She rested a few seconds only and then pushed herself to her feet , brushing her stained parts with the backs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her scratched palms onto the fabric . <p> " Hortense . " Clara 's voice rose on low laughter and sang in gentle tones from behind . " That 's not the right way out . " <p> On all fours Hortense inched up the road and tried to switch off her senses and seal herself inside her body , clenching her teeth , pressing her lips together , and squeezing her eyes shut , but she had no lids to close her ears . <p> 
##1003652 During the day my parents tried to carry on as they always had . I was impressed by the aplomb with which they behaved , " for the child 's sake . " Their ability to deceive , to be utterly different by day and by night , carved itself into my soul <p> E lived on a farm outside Abigail , Michigan , when I was a girl in the 1930s . My father was a Latin teacher , which was how I came to be called Camilla . I can not say that I have lived up to the name of Virgil 's warrior . My father served as the principal of Abigail High School , and we kept chickens and horses on our flat and scrubby land near the Ohio line . My father 's schoolwork kept him busy , so we employed a succession of hired hands for chores around the farm . Many were drunks . A weekly rite , when I was small , was for my father to pay a fine on Monday morning-6:00 A.M. , before school-and drive the befuddled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the advances for fines grew monstrous , so that our man was indentured a month ahead , he hopped a freight west . In hard times the quality of help increased , even as my father 's salary and the price of eggs went down ; he hired strong young men for three dollars a week , some of them sober . The poverty of those years touched everyone , including a protected child . I remember tramps coming to the back door ; I remember men with gray faces whom my mother succored with milk and buttered bread . I can see one of them now , preserved among the rest because he addressed me rather than my mother . " It 's hard , little girl . Could you spare a crust , little girl ? " The house was my mother 's house . She was Ella , the bright face of our family , beautiful and lively-a lover of horses , poetry , and jokes . People said , lightly , that she married my father to hold herself down . I grew up loving my quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperately loved my serene , passionate mother . What a beauty she was . When I see reproduced a Saturday Evening Post cover from the 1930s , I see my mother 's face : regular features , not large but strong ; bold cheekbones with good coloring ; dark short hair ; fullish lips , deeply red without lipstick ; large blue eyes , staring outward with a look both shy and erotic . When my mother walked into a group of strangers , the room hushed . She had grown up with four sisters , isolated on a backcountry farm in Washtenaw County . The Great War was only a distant rumor . Her childhood was a clutch of girls , a female conspiracy on a remote , patchy forty acres , in a domain of one-room schools where half the pupils belonged to her own family . They made one another clothespin dolls for Christmas ; they sewed and did fancywork in competition for their stepmother 's praise ; they passed their dreams and their dresses on to one another . How I wanted a little sister to pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me stories from her childhood , I heard themes repeated : the family was self-sufficient ( I grew up reading and rereading The Swiss Family Robinson ) and " got by on little . " When she spoke of their genuine simplicity , she spoke with wonder , not with bitterness ; she did n't make me feel guilty over my relative comfort . The Hulze farm never prospered as the Battells'my father 's family's-did for decades . The land was poor , but to survive by your own labor on your own land was triumph enough . Another theme was death , for she had lost a baby sister to a fever at eighteen months ; and her mother , Patience , died of diabetes , not long before insulin was discovered , when my mother was nine . Two years later she acquired a stepmother , my grandmother Huldah , who was kindly but fierce , with a Christianity modeled on that of Massachusetts Bay in the seventeenth century . Like my father , my mother was an eldest child ; she mothered her younger sisters even after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two more daughters . Life on the Hulze farm was hard-Monday washing , Tuesday ironing , Wednesday baking-but as my mother remembered it for me , it mustered grave satisfactions . Everyone worked equally , according to age and ability ; everyone was clothed , warm , and well fed ; in a venture of equal labor no one was dependent on another 's largesse . Weekdays were half school , half work ; the children , who rose at five , after their parents , did housework before school and darning or fancywork before bed . Saturday 's chores finished the week , and the family looked forward to a workless Sunday . Yet Huldah 's Sabbath was strenuous . Her church was two hours of hellfire in the morning , with Christian Endeavor ( hymns , visiting speakers ) at night . Sometimes Huldah searched out a Sunday-afternoon church meeting , to occupy her family for an otherwise idle moment . AN exception to my mother 's largely female nation was a dear male cousin whose story she told me as I grew older . Rudolph Howells was her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister 's boy , who lived three miles down the road . Even at ages when boys and girls avoid each other , Rudy and Ella played together . They hiked to each other 's houses , or barebacked a workhorse on a rare workless weekday ; or they met under a great willow beside a creek halfway between them . Its shelter was their hideout , and they came to call it Willow Temple . In the absence of telephones they exchanged penny postcards to arrange their meetings . For my mother , isolated among sisters in that flat countryside , the boy 's friendship was redemptive ; Rudolph was the male of my mother 's early life-after her father , who was alternately working and asleep . For Rudy , who was an only child , my mother provided the sole companionship close to his age . As she described him , Rudy sounded unnaturally solemn ; it was Ella 's childhood joy to bring out the child in Rudolph , to set him giggling or dreaming . Rudy was a reader . He brought books to my mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . In Willow Temple they recited for each other the poems they had memorized at school and performed for Prize Speaking-works by Whittier , Longfellow , Joaquin Miller , Edgar Allan Poe , James Whitcomb Riley . My mother could say " Telling the Bees " right through , without a mistake , when she was eighty . Rudolph was a " scholar , " as Michigan country people called a serious student . In 1900 few from the farmland went to college . After the Great War people began to think about college , and to assume that Rudolph would attend the University of Michigan . As my mother late in her life told stories about Rudolph , I understood that for all his studiousness he felt some diffidence about his capacities . He worried that he would not do well at college . My mother not only made him laugh but encouraged him to leave the countryside and enroll in Ann Arbor 's domestic Athens . He would excel , she told him . Then , doubtless , he would become a minister . What else did one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pastor . Rudy in his solemnity found a way to combine the romance of his reading-the South Seas , piracy , jungles of Africa-with his dark Christianity . Some speakers at Christian Endeavor were missionaries returned from outlandish places , where they had won souls to Christ , ministering to the pig-tailed hordes of China and the naked savages of the Congo . Now they traveled the Protestant Midwest to raise money for hospitals that would treat leprosy and pellagra . When he was fourteen , Rudy left his one-room school to attend an academy in the mill town of Trieste , eleven miles away . He endured his semi-exile-boarding weekdays and coming home for weekends-until he was sixteen . For two years my mother saw him at church every Sunday morning , and rarely at other moments except in summer . They wrote each other a midweek postcard . They remained so close that people teased them about being sweethearts , even about marrying-first cousins or not . My mother assured me that it would never have happened : they were too much brother and sister . One Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church members packed picnics and lunched together in a field beside Goosewater Creek , not far from Willow Temple . Ella remembered Rudy at the picnic playing with a new baby , another cousin , by trundling her carriage fast and slow , making the baby Agnes jerk and laugh with abrupt stops and accelerations . After eating deviled eggs and pork sandwiches and rhubarb pie , Ella and Rudy took a long walk together , talking about their futures , continually brushing away mosquitoes . They tramped happily among the weed trees that grew along the creek , my mother remembered , and sat inside the green dome of Willow Temple . They spoke of the university and Ella 's high school , where she took Latin because Rudy had recommended it . Ella told him jokes she had saved for him . Mostly they began , " A minister , a priest , and a Christian Science practitioner . . . " One story made him laugh until he wept ; she could never remember which one . When she was terribly old , and dying , Ella still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fields like migrant buttercups ; she remembered the blue dress she wore , embroidered with red tulips . That night , when Rudolph 's ride came to take him back to Trieste , no one could find him . He was not in his room ; he did not respond to his mother 's " Yoo-hoo ! " After half an hour his ride went off without him . His father and the hired man took lanterns from the barn and searched for him in the darkness among the outbuildings . Then they climbed the small pasture hill . I remember seeing that hill when I was a child . In my mind I can watch the yellow lanterns rise in the black evening , and hear the men 's voices calling for him : " Rudolph ! Ru-dee ! " His parents were frightened ; maybe Rudy had fallen taking a walk after five o'clock supper ; maybe he had hit his head on a rock and lay somewhere unconscious . They summoned neighbor cousins to help . Three miles away , asleep in bed , my mother knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men came back , thinking to look in the root cellar . It was Agnes 's young father , cousin Michael , who found Rudolph where he had hanged himself in the attic . As Michael walked up the steep stairs with his lantern low , his face brushed against the boots . The impact pushed the boots away , and they swung back to hit him . As long as any of his contemporaries lived , Rudolph 's suicide was the subject of speculation . Rudolph -- everyone repeated-was a sensible and lovable boy , affectionate if a little serious , " old for his age " but capable of playfulness . He loved his mother and father and his cousin Ella ; he was a happy child . Ella 's family reconstructed , by gradual accumulation of detail , the days and weeks before the tragedy occurred . No one could find anything that hinted of despair or violence . Why did a bright , cheerful , beloved seventeen-year-old boy hang himself in his attic ? Why ? Why ? Why ? Could it have been an accident ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head by accident ? People said , It must have been something he read in a book . They decided at the end of every discussion that reading stories caused Rudolph 's death . THAT Sunday night began the infection that throbbed and festered at the center of my mother 's life . Although she was warmhearted , charming , and funny , although most of her life she appeared serene or even content , I believe that a fever always burned inside her . What happened was so savage , and so inexplicable , that it never let her go . Over fifty and sixty and seventy years her incredulity remained intact . She wept when she told me this story , or made reference to it . " Oh , Camilla , " she said , " why did it happen ? " In my sexually obsessed youth I tried out the notion that something had occurred or almost occurred inside Willow Temple . But my mother 's continual , enormous astonishment-and her absence of guiltconvinced me that nothing untoward , or even unusual , had happened in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ella the erotic life concealed itself under hymns and petticoats . Part of the story was how my mother first heard the news . Monday morning , ignorant of what had happened ( ten years would pass before the Hulzes had a telephone ) , my mother took the seven o'clock train for Bosworth and its high school . Every school day of the year she and her sister Betty took the milk train . When they sat down and the locomotive jerked forward , behind them were two men who had boarded three miles north , at the depot near Rudolph 's house . My mother heard Mr. Peabody say to Mr. Gross what a terrible thing it was when his own father , just last night , had had to cut Rudolph Howells down from a beam in the attic . Why would a fine boy like Rudy go and kill himself ? My fifteen-year-old mother alighted at the first stop , took the next train back , and went to bed . ( Betty went on to school . It was part of the story , always , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for three days would not eat . She stayed home the rest of the school year , four weeks . She turned pale and lost weight ; Dr. Fowles said that she was anemic . Once a week a Trieste butcher sent two quarts of steer 's blood for Huldah to store in the ice box . My mother drank a tumbler of blood every day ; it nauseated her , but mostly she kept it down . Once , she left her bed and slipped from the house for half a day-terrifying her father and Huldah-to walk by the creek until she came to Willow Temple , where she crept inside and howled hysterical tears . ( " I thought he would be there , " she told me when she was old . " Camilla , I thought he was there . " ) Thereafter her family contrived to keep her in bed . She failed all summer , eating little , until one evening she heard Huldah 's harsh voice in the garden beyond her window telling a visitor , " We 're going to lose our big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mother back to life . By the time school opened in September , she had become bright and energetic again-brighter and more energetic than before . After her mourning she turned from a shy fifteen-year-old into the creature who caused the intake of breath . As her beauty became obvious for the first time , her youthful life began . She took part in high school literary and theatrical groups , as much as commuting allowed . A year later , in her senior year , she boarded in Bosworth weekdays . If a hayride or a square dance occurred on a Saturday night , she stayed over in town for the weekend , despite Huldah 's disapproval . The summer after graduation , when she was seventeen , she took a job at Muehlig 's department store in Ann Arbor , boarding with a family related to her mother . It was clear , when my mother recollected , that Ann Arbor raised a pleasant devil in her . When another boarder arranged a blind date for her with a university student , she entered into a new life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and remembered those years . She became popular , a powerful word in the vocabulary of the time , and dated many young men . One fraternity ( my father never belonged to one ; to join would have been unthinkable ) elected Ella Hulze its sweetheart , granting her an honor normally reserved for a sorority girl . She would have joined a sorority if she had been a student . ( When I attended the university , I joined one and quit after a year . ) My mother dated someone every night of the week , she told me , and her engagement book was full a month ahead . She made me laugh with her stories of boys she dated-a collateral Ford who drove a Stutz , a broker-to-be who waxed his red moustache into points , a fainting swain who sent long-stemmed roses to Muehlig 's . " It was innocent , " she told me when I was seventeen . Ten years later I reminded her of that word , when she stayed with me after my daughter 's birth . She laughed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me about driving to Chicago for a weekend in a roadster with two fraternity boys . They visited a speakeasy ; having taken a room at the YWCA , she had to ring a bell to be let in at 3:00 A.M. , and covered her mouth to disguise her breath . She returned to Ann Arbor on Monday at 7:00 A.M. , to drink coffee and attend her counter at Muehlig 's . A week later both boys died at dawn in the same roadster , careering off the road into a maple tree near Walled Lake after a night of Prohibition gin and jazz . When she met my father , as he shopped for Christmas presents for his family , my mother was ready to settle down . They were engaged by Easter . My mother was eighteen then , my father twenty-six . She clerked in a department store ; he was a graduate student in classical languages . People speak of the attraction of opposites . Opposites are attracted when each is anxious about its own character . ( And I am their product , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her character . ) I think of my father as he must have appeared in 1925 . He came from country people , as she did , but he wore eyeglasses and lived for books-particularly books in ancient languages . My mother had taken Latin for two years of high school , but she stopped after Rudy died . How did my father find the courage to approach the beautiful Ella Hulze ? I suppose his innocence was his courage ; eight years older , bound to his library carrel , he would not have known that she was popular . Billy , or William , had reached the moment in his life , halfway through his last year of study , with a high school teaching job waiting for him , when he was ready for courtship and marriage . Through a legacy from his godmother , who had married into Flint 's auto industry , he had $1,500 , which would provide the down payment on a house with a mortgage at two and a half percent . Possibly his studies contributed to his infatuation : I laughed when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his final seminar at Michigan had examined Ovid 's Art of Love . Like Ella , my father jolted himself into looking for an opposite . Then he met a beautiful girl , from a Michigan farm , selling scarves at Muehlig 's . MAYBE William was not quite so opposite as he appeared to be . After all , he grew up outside Abigail on a hog farm-prosperous for many decades-that his parents and his bachelor brother worked until foreclosure in 1937 . Billy became the Latinist- " William Hammersmith Battell , " as his diplomas read , and " foremost scholar in the history of Abigail High , " the Abigail Journal called himwho majored in classics at the University of Michigan . He was the first in his family to finish high school , and , of course , college . After he made Phi Beta Kappa , in 1922 , he returned to raise pigs with his father and his brother . He did this on principle , full of Roman republican notions ; he enjoyed tales of Colonial American blacksmiths who read forty lines of Hebrew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed no anomaly to my father . But my father was not a skillful farmer . When pig raising did not take his full attention , he felt inadequate or hypocritical ; in his absentmindedness he failed his agrarian ideals . The Latin language , and only the Latin language , enthralled him . Exhausted after a day among hogs , he sat by the oil lamp placed on a central table in the small living room , reading Tacitus while his mother darned and his brother studied baseball scores and his father drifted into sleep . In Virgil 's Georgics the Michigan farm crossed paths with the study of Latin . As a young man my father dreamed of translating the Georgics , adapting them to southern Michigan , but the farming tired him out ; he never completed the first book . By 1925 the family realized that the Battell farm could not support four adults . The agricultural depression had started a decade before the rest of the country crashed , and the once-rich farm began to fail . Somebody had to leave the place and get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always called it . One of his chores was to feed the piglets once they were weaned from their great mothers , carrying buckets of corn from the Battell cribs . The stored feed nourished a guerrilla army of rats . One morning my young father , weary after staying up with Virgil half the night , fed rat poison to sixty-seven young pigs . The whole family wept , even his hard father and stolid brother , as they dug a long trench on a rainy day and buried their hopes for a prosperous or even a tolerable year . When he was an old man , he still shook his head in melancholy guilt as he spoke of his lethal error . " The bags were different colors and sizes . The pellets were gray . How could I have done it ? " I remember him at seventy-four , still lamenting his terrible mistake ; he could see the pale young bodies in the rain , and puddles gathering in the trench . My mother , the family wit and teaser , knew better than to joke about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soaring high in self-confident absentmindedness , and made tea by pouring hot coffee over tea leaves , she called him " The Great Poisoner . " He laughed , I remember , but looked abashed and sorrowful . After the disaster the Battell family took out a mortgage to provide capital for my father 's M.A. at the university . Back in Ann Arbor , my father undertook courses in education as well as Greek and Latin , so that he might become a high school teacher . Two months after he returned to his studies , he met my mother in Muehlig 's . The elderly Miss Wuestefeld , of Abigail High , who had taught Billy , had told him that she would hold on until William was finished with graduate school . Thus my father revisited , ten years afterward , the classroom where he had learned to chant amo , amas , amat , eagerly leading new students to recite amo , amas , amat . It was a secure position , as everyone knew : " There 'll always be work for a Latin teacher . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loan and help to repair his conscience , mourning after the poisoned piglets . In Abigail his old schoolmates would breed him pupils and call him " professor " without irony . My parents had been married three years , and I was a baby , when the position of principal opened . My father was chosen not because of his administrative ability but because of his sex . Most teachers were women , but principals were men ; only men could deal with unruly boys . Maybe my mother was unruly too . My early life was happy-or at least it was even , like a plain as it steadily upthrust a crop of corn . The radio and the automobile were our wonders , and I measure my childhood by the names of products : the Crosley , the Emerson , the Philco ; the Model T , the brief blue Chevrolet , the Model A , which never broke down as we took rides every warm-weather Sunday afternoon , adventurously speeding at forty miles an hour over Michigan backcountry roads , knowing where we were headed without being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together in the front seat and I sat in the back , scooting from side to side in my Sunday dress as the landscape drew me . Having clear access to both sides was a luxury of only-child-hood . On these Sunday drives my parents spoke little . I watched my father 's mild , bespectacled eyes take in an Angus herd ; I gazed at my mother 's poised , beautiful profile as her face turned from side to side , calm or complacent , accepting what the route offered . Every Sunday we rode two or three hours over southern Michigan and northern Ohio , looking at cattle , chickens , turkeys , pigs , and horses . When we had driven as far as we would go , and started back , my father would search out an ice-cream parlor and treat us to a sundae . Always we returned in order to ride our horses for an hour before Sunday-night supper , which was sandwiches around the radio . I can not remember when the Jack Benny show began broadcasting , but in my old age Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheese and crushed pineapple . My mother and I rode together after school in good weather . On Saturdays as well as Sundays all three of us saddled up : my father 's horse , the roan stallion , Bigboy , unruly like a high school boy ; my mother 's Morgan mare , Benita ; and my multicolor pony , Skylark , who was large enough to carry my slight figure until I was sixteen . These handsome creatures were the enduring quotidian romance of my girlhood . After school I curried Skylark 's flanks until my mother was ready for our amble along a stony road at the side of a hayfield . Both my parents grew up with workhorses , and would have missed equine company were it not for these three , stabled in the barn adjacent to our chickens . I 'm not sure why we kept chickens , except that my father considered farming a good thing-and he no longer cared to raise pigs . Selling eggs and broilers paid for the hired men and the horses . When my mother sat on a horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Honorable Lady Something ; she wore a horse the way a model wears clothes . My father was unpredictably impetuous , an excellent rider on a capricious , powerful horse . Bigboy liked to run , and would have run away if my father had not been so masterful ; they galloped ahead of us and galloped back , pulling up in a froth of high spirits . One of my mother 's teasing names for my father was Billy Cowboy . IN my earliest recollections my parents acted like lovers , if not quite like a pastoral shepherd and his shepherdess . They were polite , in the old-fashioned way , but they took every opportunity to touch each other . When they did n't want me to understand something , they talked in Latin , or something Latinish enough to confuse me . My father delighted , in his mild , fussy way , in their domestic classicism . Equus was an early word , not to mention amor . Before I was seven , I knew that via meant both " road " and that we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day and the Model A was Sundays . I cherished those afternoons in the back seat . I cherish them still , as I approach my seventies . In my life , when I have been especially troubled-my daughter died in childhood ; I divorced my husband-I have found myself for comfort playing back mental films of those afternoons in the back seat of a Ford , exploring the flat country roads . Driving the car , my father , I imagine , daydreamed Latin . I have no notion what my mother dreamed . Maybe she thought of my father , or of Rudolph . Because Rudolph was the source of my mother 's Latin , and because he and my father were both serious , even solemn , I came to think of Rudolph as an antecedent to my father . I considered that my mother made up for losing Rudolph when she married William . I was too shy to advance this theory to her until she was well into her eighties . " Perhaps , " she said , but my notion clearly annoyed her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , and a moment later she wiped her eyes . My mother learned to drive-a fairly advanced idea for a small-town housewife in 1933-in order to go to the library , so that she and I could stock up on books . I progressed from dog-and-cat books to a wonderful poetry anthology called Silver Pennies . Next I found novels , from Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm to Black Beauty , with excursions into the Nancy Drew series , and started to inhabit the house of stories , in love with the improbable and the heroic . My mother enjoyed novels and biographies but cared more for poetry . She deserted Whittier for Wordsworth , and Longfellow for Keats , but she also admired the modems : Sara Teasdale , Edna St. Vincent Millay , John Masefield , Elinor Wylie , Edwin Arlington Robinson . She wore out a copy of Tristram . Later she found Robert Frost-my father admired Frost , the classical side-and the young Stephen Vincent Benet . It would have been too much for her to admire T. S. Eliot or Wallace Stevens ; later , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , she shook her head regretfully . My father reread Virgil , Horace , and Catullus ; he preferred Cicero 's letters to his orations ; he worked away at Thucydides , read journals of classical studies-and increasingly took part in a battle over the place of classical studies in the American high school curriculum . Voices in the 1930s proclaimed that learning Latin was impractical , that our youth , rather than waste valuable time on dead languages , should concentrate on arithmetic , mechanical drawing , and business letters . To my father , the suggestion was retrograde . In Abigail he tried to institute at least one year of Latin for all students , with four years for those few students aiming toward college . Two years of Latin were required for admission to the University of Michigan . He gave speeches after lunch at the Rotary Club ; he wrote letters to the Abigail Journal . Although principal , he still taught Latin , and because he taught with enthusiasm , Abigail 's Latin courses were well subscribed . Elsewhere the walls were falling . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Academy " from its name , he wrote a letter to The Detroit News , ending , " If our civilization is to survive encroaching darkness , Latin and Greek must keep alight the fires of learning , shining beacons that keep us to the path . " He signed it " William Hammersmith Battell , Principal , Abigail High School . " If I let him sound pompous , remember that he pursued a passion . With his duties as chairman of the Michigan Classical Association , and as secretary of the Great Lakes Latin Society , he paid less attention to our farm , haphazardly preserved by the succession of hired men . The first I remember is Herbert Ganke , an old man who talked to himself while he worked . He was courtly to me and my mother , and worked slowly but steadily . Once a month he got into trouble . Finally he passed out in a back yard after stealing clothes from the family 's clothesline . Later we hired boys who worked a week or two and vanished ; a sweet hobo named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hired man 's room . He disappeared after one payday , around the time the snowdrops poked up . A shy , handsome local boy named Raymond was marvelous with horses , and could even control the volatile Bigboy . Raymond was illiterate , my mother discovered , and she taught him to read . Late afternoons , when my father came home from school , and my mother and I were back from our ride , he changed into overalls , consulted with the latest hand , and checked out the hens while my mother cooked supper . I attended the one-room school a quarter of a mile away , and sometimes brought a friend , Caroline or Rebecca , back to play ; but on rainy days , or when I played alone with my dollhouse or read stories , I interrupted myself to visit the barn and the outbuildings with Herbert or Raymond or Miller , to curry Skylark and feed apples to Skylark , Benita , and ( carefully ) Bigboy . Some hands were grumpy , possibly not fond of small girls , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke cigarettes and tell the stories of their lives . With Raymond , I was in love ; after school I liked it when Raymond sat at the kitchen table doing his ABCs under my mother 's supervision , reading my dog-and-cat books , moving on to Silver Pennies. 
##1003653 The disaster was great for me and Scud . We were given time off school to help clear up the beaches . Not that we did much . There were experts fixing the birds . And there were men in orange suits spraying the sea with chemicals . Everyone in the town wanted to do something but no one could really do anything . There were some people standing around just crying . Old Bill Western from the market was crying -- me and Scud saw him with snot at the end of his nose , muttering " the birds , the birds " to himself like a poem . <p> Everywhere you looked there was oil and people in plastic suits . It was like the high season and for us and it was all excitement . " Let 's get oil on our shoes and leave trails through the streets , " we said ; " Let 's go into Seaview Gifts and mess up Phellp 's carpet ; " but they would n't let us on the beach . <p> The oil was good for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They needed volunteers up at the estuary for a week 's work , and he went up there to help ; he packed his case and put on his galoshes and oilskins and he looked like he was going to war or something . <p> " I 'm not sure what I can do , but at least I can do something , " e said , and I was dead proud of him even though it was n't a real job . <p> When he was gone my mother was like a different person . She smiled and put on extra makeup and she gave me money to get sweets from Bunce 's . Me and Scud bought Superchews and then went down to watch the people cleaning up the beach and the birds being loaded into the caskets : they were limp and their eyes were white and they were quiet like they got such a shock that they forgot how to squork -- or maybe the oil had got inside their lungs or voice box or whatever it is that birds have . <p> It was bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that slick came to town things got better for me , and the black mood lifted off from house ; I could time it to the day that Da went to the estuary . The shouting and swearing stopped then . According to Mam , Da had these black moods although how she saw what colour they were I 'm not sure . But sometimes the mood got so bad that we all had to tread slowly around the house like we were walking in mud bog . But with Da gone for a week my mother cheered up and there was a holiday atmosphere . <p> Me and Scud went looking for the BBC and the newspaper men . We decided that we would give interviews and if they asked us we would say that the disaster was great for pocket money and parents and it gave out Das something to do . We 'd say that it made my mother happy and that we were given time off school and that we felt important what with the town being on the telly . Obviously we would say that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their feathers and the slick and everything but like my Mam says you should n't go on and on about it . <p> Scud found a newsman from London and he told him that they should send us food like they do for the Africans because we would n't have a damn thing to eat now because all we ate down here was fish , which was a lie because we ate chips and burge most of the time and the only fish we had was fish fingers . Scud was annoyed afterwards because the man said he was n't filming him ; and anyway he forgot to tell him that his Da knew that the reason for it was Arabs getting revenge for all the oil we blew up in that war . <p> Everyone around us was sad but we were happy like clowns . So we went round and laughed and shouted . Everyone was talking about it all the time and their faces were like sad cods and their favourite words were ruined and terrible and I could see the colour of their moods and like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came round to our house . Chaz owned the Royale guest house overlooking the harbor and he wore purple shirts . He always had a tan because in the winter he went to Spain and in the summer he worked here . Chaz came round and he was in the kitchen talking to Mam when I walked in . Chaz was taller than my Da and he had more money than Da but for all that I preferred my Da . <p> " Da 's gone to help the disaster , " I told him . " He 's living in billets and saving the birds . " " Hope he can save my bookings , " Chaz said . " I 've had three cancellations . " <p> Chaz had one of his shirts on and he gave off this smell like our bath after Mam had been in it . <p> I was thinking that if he was so worried why was n't he up in the estuary helping out , like Da . <p> " You should go up to the estuary , " I said to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run here , " my Mam said and I never knew why she called him Mr. Thomas to me when to him she said Chaz in private because I 'd overheard them once . <p> " Why do n't you go and watch telly , " my Mam said . " You might see Da . " And I thought that was a great idea so I went upstairs . <p> I watched the news on three channels and the disaster was first on two of them and second on the other but Da was n't on the news . They showed the estuary and there were thousands of men in suits like they were on the moon and I thought that Da was one of those men . <p> I saw the town and the estuary and interviews and dead birds and tractors in the sand and birds being washed and looking funny . God I never saw so many birds . It took all that oil to show us all the birds we had living here . After the last news I saw Chaz leaving downstairs and kissing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Da and thought he should get a medal or something for helping out like that . Stud 's Da could n't leave his shop , but Chaz Thomas could have helped if he was so worried about his guests . Da was there now probably up to his neck in oil and holding up a cormorant in one hand and a guillemot in the other and people cheering and saying , " Give him a medal , give him a medal . " <p> Over the next few days things calmed down a bit . There were n't so many people driving to the town to have a gawp at the sea and take photos . The television people left town and on the news they only had the disaster fifth and seventh . Even the papers did n't talk about it , except for locals ... but I suppose there was more important news what with bombs and the princess and whatnot and you ca n't bore people with the same old story . <p> In school Talbot got us to write a story about the disaster . I wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Miss Evans got us to draw the disaster and we put paint on our hands and made marks on white paper and it looked like oil . Then the headmaster told us to pray that the town would be all right by the summer , and I thought about Chaz 's guests but I did n't want to ask God for them . By the end of it all I 'd had it up to my head with that blinking oil . It was getting into every little conversation and sticking all over people and getting them down like birds and now the teachers were giving us lessons on it . <p> Mam 's cherry mood soon flew off and she was damn moody with me and it was because Da was coming back soon . She went out late one night and Da called and I was n't sure where Mam was so said she was probably talking to the BBC or something . <p> Da sounded like a different person on the phone . He sounded happy like his mood had flown off him and he talked and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on a great adventure . He said they had rescued two thousands birds or something and that the tanker was bigger than Cardiff Arms Park . <p> I envied him being up there is the billets saving the world . <p> Me and Scud stayed cheerful and went down to the harbor and threw stones into the slick which was thick as treacle and moving nowhere like a pond . We tried to skim some flatties but they never bounced they just stuck there then . We walked back and saw a shark but it was n't it was a seal and it was dead and I felt sick and I thought about Bill Western crying in the street and I wanted to cry myself but I did n't because of Scud . Scud said that that stupid seal should have slid through the oil but he had n't . Whatever Da was doing up at the estuary it was n't making things any better , I thought . <p> I was a picture of town in County Clothes and the sand was gold and every was smiling and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was stuck there like a black pond , and I thought that if I was a fish I would get out fast and swim to America or Devon . The disaster was n't on the new anymore although when Da called you 'd think it was still more important than the wars in the world and the princess and all the other news that was going on . <p> Chaz Thomas was round again . He was moaning about his guest house and how it would be a real disaster for him . Mam made him drinks and she kept sighting and saying to me how terrible it wad for Mr. Thomas and that he would be ruined . <p> Maybe that 's why she was being friendly to him , she felt sorry for him and maybe it was a disaster for him but he was n't a cormorant or a seal and he was still going to Spain for his holiday . I suppose you can kiss someone if you feel sorry for them . <p> At school Scud said that Chaz Thomas was in love with my Mam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pipe . He was n't mean when he said it he just told me and he went red . I said that Mam just felt sorry for Chaz Thomas because it was a real disaster for him . I was glad to see Da back . He came in the evening and he looked like the man on top of a mountain smiling and knackered and he was full of tales , he said . I listened to him and I wanted to know it all but Mam sent me upstairs to watch telly and she said she wanted to talk to Da . I thought that maybe she wanted to talk to Da about me or maybe tell him about Chaz 's bookings and how upset he was . <p> The next day at breakfast Mam was n't around and Da was quiet and his eyes looked like that cormorant I saw all white and staring fearful like he got a shock . Maybe the black mood had come back and I thought I would wash it off if I had the right chemicals and whatnot . <p> I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spain . Then I saw that he was crying and thought that maybe he had seen too many dead birds . <p> " You did your best , Da , you did your best , " I told him . But he stayed like he could n't move . I guess that you had to be a grown-up to appreciate a disaster like that . <p> 
##1003654 Constitutionally , temperamentally , against the grain of his better intentions , his background and even many of his actions , Wendell Spear , the film critic and historian , was avaricious . <p> Well , not quite . Avarice did n't do justice to Spear 's feelings about money . After his wife Vanessa 's death , money became a kind of companion to him , almost a child . The nurturing and growth of his small wealth brought him a profound ease and -- though he knew this was absurd -- pride . <p> Every morning , waking , he reached for his bedside phone , pressed its memory button and , successively , the numbers which summoned the electronic voices which reported the status of his accounts . The rare times when there was a glitch in either the reporting system or his account , Spear was gripped by anxiety and anger until he could reach his broker 's office and learn what , thank God , had , so far , been a reporting error which , for anxious minutes , appeared to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in late August , a letter from the Treasury Department informed him that he was subject to a tax audit , Spear felt a terror unlike anything he 'd known since Vanessa 's death . Why , after all his placid , solitary yeas in his Malibu Canyon cabin had he been singled out ? Dismay , astonishment , fear , rage . <p> The letter was personalized to the extent of specifying the year the IRS was auditing , 1993 , and the areas of its concern , his Contributions and Business Expenses . It also indicated the place and time of the audit , the Federal Building on Los Angeles Street , and the auditor 's sinister , comic name , G. Whipp . <p> Spear 's longtime accountant , Zack Wool , filed his taxes from Los Angeles , where Spear had lived till his move to Malibu . It accounted for the location of the audit and for another dimension of his anxiety , the hour 's drive on the freeways . The freeways were the incarnation , or rather impetrification , of his fears . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't enjoy a single night of peaceful sleep . <p> He called Wool 's office . Frances , the secretary , said , " I 'm sorry , Mr. Spear . He 's in South America . " <p> " In flight ? " <p> " Vacation . He takes September off . " <p> " It 's August . " <p> " He 'll be back September 20 . " <p> " The audit 's September 18 . " <p> " I can request a postponement . They 're good about granting them . " <p> " I may not last till September 18 . I 'll go myself . " <p> That afternoon Spear dug out of a closet the manila envelopes which held his 1993 tax forms , checks , receipts , bankbooks , VISA and Discover bills and went to work . <p> After two hours ' immersion , he went out to the terrace from whose eaves still hung the inverted blue bottles which , so long ago , Vanessa had filled with sugar water for hummingbirds . ( The hummingbirds had departed with her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , palms and cypress , he prepared himself for the actual hearing . He 'd wear his oldest decent suit , blue , a frayed blue shirt and a faded blue tie . No , the wrong look . Too much blue . Too much attention to color coordination . The artist disguises his art ; the con man also . He needed a shirt that clashed , not enough to agitate a color-sensitive auditor , but enough to suggest an old widower , careful but a bit at sea . Maybe an off-white shirt with black stripes . No , these were prison colors . The lemon-green with a few honorable white threads at the collar . For shoes , the ugly , broad-toed ones with worn-down heels . He 'd polish them to show how careful he was of his old , unfashionable things . Whipp would see a decent , even fastidious man , straightforward , plain , a not-quite-with-it man , a bald , sexagenarian widower keeping up as well as he could . <p> Would the auditor sniff something askew ? After all , he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but probably three times bigger than Whipp 's own . I 'm saving for my granddaughter , Mr. Whipp . I 'm not a spender . I skimp , but not on taxes . I pay what I owe . My accountant , Zack Wool , is descended from a Confederate general . He 's stricter than a ruler . I 'm sure he makes me pay more than I should . I 'm hoping to get a refund . <p> Spear went back to the checks and receipts , expenses and charities , almost thirty of them , to some of which -- thinking to avoid just such an encounter -- he 'd given $10 or less . The more checks , the more scrupulous the taxpayer and the wearier the auditor . In 1993 , however , there were several unusual deductions . The biggest was the gift of part of his film library and filmography to Claremont College . The appraiser -- Deirdre Seale , Mr. Whipp , a respectable professional -- had valued the library at $7,426.00 . Was this the nail on which the IRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ms. Seale 's letter , a two page account of her credentials and a detailed description of the gift . Detailed , yes , but impregnable ? Perhaps Ms. Seale had left a trail of overassessments which the omniscient Whipp followed ? <p> Omniscient . <p> Who knew what Whipp knew ? The myrmidons of the IRS had immense resources , terrifying power . About money , they might know everything -- more than everything ! Spear had heard a hundred horror stories : people , companies , studios tied up in decades of litigation , tax penalties mounting at each stage of appeal . <p> Beyond appeal , beyond litigation , beyond impoverishment , loomed prison . <p> Spear knew prisons . He 'd seen Jimmy Cagney , George Raft , Humphrey Bogart , Wallace Beery and Burt Lancaster behind iron bars ; he 'd seen brutal wardens , guards with guns ready , willing and eager to shoot prisoners diverting themselves momentarily from sticking cell-made shivs into each others ' flanks . Gangs , extortion , rape . Could a man like himself last a day in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandson of his friend Alice , the cashier at the Mobil station , had been sent away for six months : reckless driving and endangerment . Said Alice , " It turned him around , Mr. S. Fellow in the next cell , a stockbroker , put him onto books . Now he talks of nothing but learning the Latin language . I asked him , ' Does this mean you want to be a priest ? ' ' Just the opposite , ' he tells me . Whatever that means . " Roger , an oil-stained giant , had grown up in the service station , not , like Spear , in an English rectory filled with the Latin books Roger apparently craved . ( Although he had n't read one in twenty years , Spear had not given Claremont his father 's red and gold Loeb Library Classics . ) A minimum-security prison with three square meals a day and stockbroker companions was a step up for him , but for Spear , who lived in the ease of unsupervised , self-pampered solitude , it would be living death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor of the old Federal Office Building . For his 9 A.M. appointment , Spears was on the Santa Monica Freeway at 7:00 and on Los Angeles Street at 7:00 . Carrying his schoolboy 's briefcase stuffed with rubberbanded papers , he walked around the block to compose himself . <p> On the twelfth floor , he gave his name to a lovely , already weary black woman who told him to " sit in reception , " a bleak beige room with three rows of blue plastic chairs and windows so begrimed Spear did not bother trying to see what could have been a fine view west over the city to the Pacific . Briefcase on his knees , he sat on the blue plastic seat like a penitent . <p> A small elderly black man sat two seats away . " Morning , " he said . He wore bright green slacks and a Hawaiian sport shirt ; no blue suit and frayed shirt for him . This was Southern California ; not even funeral directors wore blue suits . <p> " Good morning . " <p> " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " They wanting twenty-five hundred bucks from me . " <p> " Pretty steep . " <p> " My cousin , he took my social security , went round the Southwest hanging paper . " He tapped a vinyl briefcase . " I got copies two of his checks . " <p> " Looks like you 're home free then . " <p> " Think so ? " <p> " I do , " said Counselor Spear . <p> " Mr. McKeeney ? " A stout Chinese woman in a lavender pantsuit stood in the doorway . <p> " That 's me , " said the man , rising . <p> Spear watched them disappear round an L-leg of a corridor . The elevator discharged a wheelchair which rolled toward the reception area . Spear looked , then looked away from its occupant , a tiny white man in a brown corduroy workshirt and blue pants from which hung tiny shoes . " Not enough that God has afflicted the poor fellow , the IRS has to pursue him . " Then he heard what was surely his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp , high-pitched voice . <p> Spear looked at the wheelchair . " Mr. Whipp ? " <p> The man had an almost normal-sized head which was jammed , neckless , onto small corduroyed shoulders . " Pleath follow me . " <p> Spear rose , his seventy inches heavy with normality . He followed the double-wheeled throne of his auditor down the long corridor and into a cubicle . Mr. Whipp 's arm pointed him to a wooden chair . He wheeled himself behind the desk . On a table to his left were a telephone , a small American flag on a stand and a six inch plastic Venus de Milo . <p> " Well , Mr. Sthpear , " he said with a pleasant smile , " Thall we begin ? " <p> " I 'm ready . " <p> Whipp opened a manila envelope in front of him . " I 'm going to wead you your wighth . " <p> The familiar phrase , even in Whipp 's infantile phonemes , coiled around Spear 's already contracted heart . " You thould have copieth of thith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekth , I 'll mail you a weport . If you do n't agwee wiv it , you can call me or my thupervithor . If we do n't thatithfy you , you can appeal . If -- " <p> " Yes , I did read that , Mr. Whipp . " <p> " Have you ever been audited before ? " <p> " No . " <p> Whipp drew a paper from the folder . He said kindly , " It theemth you were -- back in 1968 . " <p> " Really ! " Vanessa had done their taxes , but yes , he remembered something . Had n't the auditor come to their house in Beverly Glen ? " My wife handled our finances . I 'm a widower now . " <p> " I thee . " This was not an expression of sympathy : Whipp was looking at papers which specified the date of Vanessa 's death . " Now I will wead you a litht of thingth . Would you pleath anthwer yeth or no to each ? Have you any income from weal ethtate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invethtmenth ? " <p> " Only the royalties described in the return . " <p> " Drug-dealing ? " <p> " No . " <p> " Mining ? " <p> " No . " <p> " Currenthy twanthactionth ? " <p> " I do n't speculate . Except for the investments listed . " <p> At each of Spear 's answers , Whipp checked off boxes . He put the paper on a pile and pulled out a long pad of yellow paper . " Thall we begin with Contributionths ? " <p> Spear undid the leather thongs on his briefcase and withdrew the envelope in which he 'd put charitable checks , receipts and acknowledgments . <p> Whipp said , " There ith the matter of the car you donated to the half-way houthe . " For years , Spear had given his old cars to an ex-actor who ran a halfway house for ex-prisoners and addicts . The actor tuned up the cars , then sold them to support the house . " I think the appraithal ith too high . " <p> " It 's his appraisal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high . Do you know the Blue Book appraithal of an eighty-thwee Buick ? " <p> " No . " <p> " I 'll look it up . I think we have to go by that . " <p> " It had an exceptionally good stereo system . " An exaggeration . <p> " It'th hard to appraith thingth . Do you have any retheits for the thound thystem ? " <p> " I probably did , " lied Spear , " but I do n't know where they are . " <p> Whipp wrote on the lined pad . " I thee . We 'd better uthe the Blue Book . " He looked up as if awaiting Spear 's approval . Spear nodded , and bending low over the pad , Whipp wrote more , his fist encircling the ballpoint pen as if writing required every bit of his strength and concentration . " Now we thould look at the donathon of the film bookth and -- thith ith a new word to me -- filmogwaphy . " His accent was on gwaph . " To the college libwary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appraiser 's letters and the college 's thank-you note here . " <p> " Your accountant thubmitted them . " <p> " Is there a problem ? " <p> " Ith a filmo-gwaphy movieth ? " <p> " Mine 's a detailed , alphabeticized description of films , categorized by genre . " <p> " What is genre ? " <p> " Type of film . Comedy , tragedy . Whatever . " <p> " I thee . " His neckless head bobbed in appreciative comprehension . <p> " I think we can acthept thith appraithal . " <p> " Fine , " said Spear , surprised at the depth of his delight . <p> Whipp wrote several more lines , then looked up . " Charitieth ? You have lotth of thmall oneth , thome under Mithellaneouth . Of courth , people ca n't document everything . Like you go to church and put in a few dollarth . " <p> " That 's right , " said Spear who had n't been to church since he 'd listened to his father 's tortured sermons forty-odd years ago . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , Spear occasionally contesting , Whipp nodding , agreeing , asking for documentation . " The IREth wo n't accthept undocumented twanthacthionth . " <p> " I understand . I wish I 'd kept everything . " <p> " I know that'th hard to do . " <p> An hour , two hours , three hours , Whipp and Spear faced each other over the checks , receipts , appraisals and assessments scattered over the desk . <p> " You mutht be getting hungry . Would n't it be better to make another appointment ? " <p> " Lord God no , Mr. Whipp . I 'd like to get it over now , if that 's all right . " <p> " All right . We 're almotht finithed . " <p> The final twenty minutes went by in a blur . Drained , Spears agreed to everything , but he held the impression that most of his claims were being accepted . What a good , decent person Whipp was . How beautifully he handled his deformity and handicaps . He touched Spear 's heart . When they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a film festival in San Francisco , Whipp said , " Than Fwanthithco ith thuch a beautiful thity . I wath there oneth , for four dayth . It wath my happietht perthonal time . " <p> The drive home on the freeway and coast highway was actually pleasant : few cars , much relief . Home , Spear slept , till wakened by the phone . " Mr. Sthpear ? " <p> " Mr. Whipp . Is anything wrong ? " <p> " You left your briefcathe here . " <p> " How careless of me . " <p> " What thall I do with it ? " <p> " Why do n't you keep it as a souvenir ? " Spear almost said . " I 'll have to come get it , unless you could possibly mail it to me . Of course I 'd reimburse you . " <p> " I might be able to do that , " said Whipp . " Let me athk at our potht offith . " <p> It happened that Jennifer , Spear 's granddaughter , had been sent down from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the street from the Federal Office Building . She was spending the night with Spear , a rare treat for him . She said she 'd pick up the briefcase during her lunch break . <p> That night , she said , " The people in the office here all know him . At least they 've seen him in the street being carried into taxis . " <p> " What did he say to you ? " <p> " Not very much . He was embarrassed , I think , a bit gruffer than he might have been with you . All he said was , ' I have it right here . ' Strange lisp . Maybe because his throat 's constricted . " <p> " I 'm sure he was delighted to see you . I do n't imagine he -- gets a chance to talk to attractive girls . " For Spear , Jennifer was lovelier than any film star , a solid , pink-cheeked Natalie Wood or Winona Ryder , or like the eighteen-year-old Hannah Arendt as she was spotted in the Freiburg lecture hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week , " said Spear . " And you probably improved my case . " He decided to send Jennifer whatever refund he got . " It makes me feel good about technology . Fifty or sixty years ago , Whipp would n't have been able to get a job in a circus ; they do n't use cripples . He 'd have been human junk . " <p> " He makes the case for affirmative action , " said Jennifer . " One up for the US of A. " <p> Three and a half weeks later , Whipp 's report arrived , six pages long and so ambiguously phrased that Spear could n't tell whether he owed money or was getting some back . There were also spelling errors and such peculiarities as credit for a safe-deposit box which Spear had n't listed , let alone claimed . <p> The upshot , though , was that Whipp disagreed with much of what Spear thought he 'd agreed to , and Spear owed thirty-four hundred dollars , including two years ' interest . It was not a great sum of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assessment , that would end it , but something held him back . He felt his new friend was n't such a friend after all , and this made him both angry and sad . It also occurred to him that if he agreed to Whipp 's refusal to recognize , say , the tax deductibility of a film festival , then other Whipps could question other returns , past and future . The thirty-four hundred dollars could be the first of many installments . <p> He called Zack Wool . " How was Machu Picchu ? " <p> " They keep it up very nicely . What can I do you for , Wendell ? How was the audit ? Sorry I was n't there , though I 'm sure you handled it well . Plus if I 'd gone , it would have cost you a bundle . " <p> " I thought it went all right , till I got the report just now . The guy went back on everything I assumed he agreed to . I owe them thirty-four hundred dollars . Not a fortune -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's thirty-four hundred too much . " <p> " It 's the business of questioning my way of life . If I 'd been buying hardware instead of watching movies , he would have accepted everything without question . My business is seeing films . If it looks like fun , let him try writing about them . Incidentally , he 's a crippled dwarf , in a wheelchair . I actually liked him . I 'm hurt he turned his back on me . I do n't know what to do . " <p> " Appeal . " <p> " Is it worth it ? " <p> " Is your time so valuable ? " <p> " My leisure 's valuable . " <p> " Is it worth seventeen hundred bucks an hour ? It 'll only take a couple of hours . " <p> " Plus the ride from Malibu . " <p> " If we win , that 's deductible . " <p> Wool had spent the weekend in Santa Barbara and said he 'd pick Spear up at his cabin . <p> " Make it the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to drive up the canyon . I leave my car there , they know me . " <p> The appointment with Whipp was at 1 P.M .. Wool said he 'd pick Spear up at noon , cutting it too close for Spear who liked to be early for appointments . He was down at the station talking to Alice at 11:30 . At 11:40 he started looking up the road for Wool 's car . At ten of , he began cursing . <p> " What 's up , Mr. Spear , " called Roger , who between stints at the gas pump was reading a Latin grammar behind the cash register counter , shoes up on a five gallon oil can . <p> " I do n't like people who are n't on time . It 's a phobia . " <p> " When was he supposed to be here ? " <p> " Noon . " <p> " It 's ten of . " <p> " Tempus fugit . " A week ago , Roger asked Sear if he 'd consider giving him Latin lessons . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing I 'm less qualified to do is train you to be an astronaut . " He used the station phone to call Wool 's office . " Where 's your boss , Frances ? We have an appointment at one . " <p> " He said he 'd be picking you up , Mr. Spear . I know he 'll be there . " <p> " Can you call his car ? " <p> " He wo n't use cellular phones , says they 're carcinogenic . " <p> " I 've got a good mind to drive myself . " <p> " I do n't blame you Mr. Spear . Mr. Wool is soo deliberate it 's exasperating . But he is reliable . " <p> " I 'll give him five minutes , then I 'm taking off . He can meet me there if he likes . G. Whipp , twelfth floor . " <p> " I 'll tell him , sir , but please hold just a bit , I 'm sure he 's on his way . " <p> Spear looked down the road , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing . He started to back out his car when he heard something . Shutting off the motor , he looked down the road and saw a black dot . <p> Wool offered no apology . In fact , he said he wanted to drop by his office to pick up Spear 's file . <p> Suppressing the rage that burst from his anxiety , Spear said coldly , " There 's no time for that , Zack . I do n't want to be late . I like to have a few minutes to compose myself , and I do n't think I 'll have them . " <p> " Whatever you say , Wendell . I 'll just wing it . " <p> On the coast highway , Spear stewed at Wool 's molasses pace and over-caution . Every time a car passed , honking to get Wool over to the right , Spear wanted to strangle him . " He should n't be allowed to have a Lexus . " <p> Wool picked up speed on the freeway . Cars still passed them every other second , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a block from the Federal Building . Spear scrambled along at a pace that caused the much younger Wool to huff and puff . <p> In the reception area , Spear , pretending to look through his papers , sat a row away from Wool . When he saw the wheelchair at the end of the corridor , he got up , opened the glass door and greeted Whipp , who today was in tie and shirt . His shoes too , looked new , shiny , tiny black Oxfords which hung from his withered legs . " Mr. Wool . Mr. Whipp . " <p> Wool leaned over and took Whipp 's small hand . " I 'm the signature at the bottom of the page . You may have seen it at the bottom of other returns . " <p> How tight the blue tie looked on Whipp 's necklessness . He was balder than Spear recalled , the remnants of light brown hair like torn curtains on the sides of his head . He did seem more comfortable today , perhaps knowing that there 'd be no shocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have prepared the accountant for his appearance . " Pleathe follow me . " He rolled up the corridor , going this time to a door with an alarm system whose buttons he pressed . " Could you pleathe get the door ? " Spear opened it , then followed the chair left and right into Whipp 's cubicle . " Thame offithe , " he said . There was , though , a new ornament , a pumpkin with an unlit candle inside . Had Whipp carved it himself or had some grateful client brought it for Halloween ? <p> " I 've done a little wethearch on allowable deductionth for authorth . You are a full-time author , Mr. Sthpear , are n't you ? " <p> " I suppose so . I do sometimes lecture , but basically I am a film critic and historian . " <p> " A hithtorian ith an author ? <p> " Yes . " <p> " Mr. Spear is modest , Mr. Whipp , " said Wool . " He 's a very distinguished film critic and historian . His main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That'th what I thought . Therth a cathe here " -- he picked up a xeroxed page -- " 3/26/71 UTh Dithtrict Court , thentral Dithtrict California .

" <p> " Gwiffith'th paperth were in New York , thith man lived in California . He claimed twavel and living expentheth for the taxable year . Owiginally , the claimth were dithalowed , but , on appeal , it wath dethided that the expentheth were deductible .

" <p> " Absurd and unfair , " said Spear . " She 'd give her pupils the benefit of her new knowledge of the language and the country . " <p> Whipp opened his palms helplessly .

They would not allow me to deduct your expentheth in Than Fwanthithco unleth you had a contract to write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Wool touched his arm , " Our contention is that Mr. Spear 's status as a film critic and historian depends upon his keeping up with what 's going on in films around the world . If he does n't do that , there will be no contracts , no invitations to write articles or books . It 's not a question of not being required by an employer to go to such festivals . Mr. Spear is self-employed . " <p> " If I do n't keep up , I wo n't be employed at all . Do n't you see , Mr. Whipp , that you 're undermining my very way of life ! " <p> Whipp shook his head . " I wethpect your way of life very much , Mr. Sthpear . I 'm thure that you are a very fine and important critic . I underthtand how important it ith for you to keep up with filmth .

" <p> " As a matter of fact , I do . Keeping journals is part of my work . " <p> " Very good . " Spear handed over the notebook . Whipp looked it over , turned the pages and handed it back . " It'th a bit hard to wead . Could you pleathe wead the entry for , thay , February 13th ? " <p> Spear took the notebook and began to read a description of his breakfast and said , " I 'd better go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Spear read a section about a new Chinese film , an account of the plot along with speculations about its political and social undercurrents , the quality of the acting and directing , the beauty of the editing and color .

I 'm not just talking about the money now , Mr. Whipp . I can afford to pay the IRS what it wants , but I ca n't afford to give it my life . It 's my life that it 's questioning . That you 're questioning . The serious business of my life . " <p> " I 'm not quethtioning your bithineth , Mr. Sthpear . " <p> " I agree , Wendell . Mr. Whipp knows that you 're a serious critic of films , but , " Wool turned to Whipp , " Mr. Spear has put our case well , if more emotionally than I might . " <p> " I underthtand that . " <p> " All his experience goes into what he writes , and though we know that some experience , say , taking a drive or a walk is nondeductible , going to a film festival or doing research for an article or book should be . " <p> " I agwee with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's taxes for thirty years . I do the taxes of many film people . You 've probably seen my signature . I do n't let my clients get away with things . With Wendell Spear , I have no worries . He 's not a person who tries to get away with anything . " <p> Spear felt himself flushing . Of course he tried to get away with things . He was only less bold than others , more fearful of the consequences . There were drops of sweat in Wool 's brow furrows , gray hairs curled out of the inverted crescents of his eyebrows . Wool was worked up . " If he does a review for a local paper and gets twenty-five dollars for it , he notes it down . He is what you call a straight arrow . " <p> " You might thay a weal Sthpear , " said Whipp smiling . <p> Spear smiled too . What a little card he was . A sort of critic , too , observing the actors who performed their evasions in front of him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems here and now . If not . . . " <p> " You can appeal to my thupervithor . " Whipp sounded not only sympathetic but encouraging . " And if that doeth n't work , the taxth board . They may thee your cathe ath you thee it . " Wide went the little palms , wide the smile . Spear surged with affection for him . If things were different , they might be friends , though Whipp 's friends -- if he had them -- would have their hands full lifting his chair and him , helping him dress , helping him in the bathroom . <p> Two days later , Whipp 's revised examination report was in his mailbox . It was clear that no midnight oil had been burned . The only difference from the first report was that he allowed Spear two per diems at the film festival : sixty-eight dollars . Zack Wool 's bill would quadruple that . At this rate , the appeal process would cost a fortune . <p> Disappointed , even angry , still , once again , Spear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debated calling him up to remonstrate or even plead with him to see his side of things . " You 're suggesting that I do n't go to festivals or do archival research since I can review films or lecture about them without going or researching . Do n't you -- wo n't you -- see that the quality of the reviews and lectures will be lower ? Is that what you -- or the IRS -- want to do , lower the quality of a person 's work ? It almost makes someone like me -- " Spear was talking out loud to the trees -- " an old-fashioned liberal , an admirer of Attlee and Harold Wilson , FDR and Harry Truman , want to side with Republicans . " If the green palms , so loftily at home against the blue sky , said anything , it was " pay the two dollars . " <p> Spear took the mail into his study , signed the form which said that he agreed with the assessment and would no longer contest or appeal it and wrote out a check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the sentence about not contesting or appealing and wrote in the space provided for Other Comments . <p> I sign this agreement and pay the full amount required but wish to go on record here that I disagree with the Auditor 's interpretation of my claim . If I had the energy I used to have , I would pursue the matter and believe that I could substantiate my case in tax court . I say this without any feeling of animus towards the Auditor , Mr. G. Whipp , whom I found to be a person of humanity . <p> Wendell R. Spear <p> A week later , Frances , Wool 's secretary , called him . " Mr. Wool wants to know if you heard from the auditor yet . " <p> " I should have let him know , Frances . I did . There was no change to speak of . I mailed in the check . " <p> " Do you want to speak to him ? " <p> " I wo n't bother him , Frances . I followed my instinct . And my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " One of these days , Frances , I 'm going to take you to lunch . " <p> " I ca n't wait , Mr. Spear . I 'll tell Mr. Wool . Not about the lunch . " <p> A delightful little woman , divorced , if he remembered correctly . Maybe she 'd be willing to go to lunch with Mr. Whipp . Who knew what that might lead to . The mysteries of companionship , or , for that matter , of solitude . Whipp seemed to be a happy man , as Spear was , perhaps because he too had the best wife of all , life itself . <p> That evening , after his spaghetti and Napa Valley cabernet , Spear walked the canyon road under the stars . A Pacific wind had blown away the smog , the sky was thick with brightness . At least the audit , thank God , was over . " It was good for you , " Spear told himself , almost as if he were his father in the rectory , backed by walls of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auditing . " <p> Spear himself had been a strict auditor of those around him . His daughter , Jennifer 's mother , had early turned from him , and , in a way , so had Vanessa . ( Dying was the way . ) As a critic too , he was famously strict , weighing every film against not only the greatest films , but the greatest novels . Some producers had stopped giving him passes . <p> I was harsher than the stars . No wonder everyone turned away from me . I did n't seek solitude , it was my penalty . <p> The Almighty , that Ultimate Auditor , had raked Whipp 's tiny body , legs , torso , tongue , yet also had filled it with honey . Divine Bookkeeping , how bizarre . <p> Next day , hardly thinking , Spear fetched the twenty-six red and gold Latin volumes of the Loeb Classical Library from his shelves and drove them down to the Mobil station . Roger was n't there , but his grandmother was . " I promised these books to Roger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read them anymore . " <p> Another oddity : Spear stopped making his morning calls to the electronic voices . When he finally did realize that he 'd stopped , he erased their numbers from the phone 's memory bank and substituted Jennifer 's , the Mobil station 's -- and surprising himself again -- his daughter 's . <p> 
##1003655 I never thought I could fall for a spaceman . I mean , you see them in the newspaper and they kind of give you the willies , all skinny and hairless and wiggly-looking , and if you touched one , even to shake hands , you just know it would be like when you were about fifteen and you were with an earth boy and you were sweet on him but there was this thing he wanted , and you finally said okay , but only rub-a-dub , which is what we called it around these parts when I was younger , and it was the first time ever that you touched ... well , you know what I 'm talking about . Anyway , that 's what it 's always seemed like to me with spacemen , and most everybody around here feels about the same way , I 'm sure . Folks in Bovary , Alabama , and environs -- by which I mean the KOA camp off the interstate and the new trailer park out past the quarry -- everybody in Bovary is used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to talk to and so forth . Take my daddy . When I showed him a few years ago in the newspaper how a spaceman had endorsed Bill Clinton for president and they had a picture of a spaceman standing there next to Bill Clinton -- without any visible clothes on , by the way -- the spaceman , that is , not Bill Clinton , though I would n't put it past him , to tell the truth , and I 'm not surprised at anything they might do over in Little Rock . But I showed my daddy the newspaper and he took a look at the spaceman and he snorted and said that he was n't surprised people like that was supporting the Democrats , people like that do n't even look American , and I said no , Daddy , he 's a spaceman , and he said people like that do n't even look human , and I said no , Daddy , he 's not human , and my daddy said , that 's what I 'm saying , make him get a job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it turned out , fell pretty hard . I met him in the parking lot at the twenty-four-hour Wal-Mart . We used to have have a regular old Wal-Mart that would close at nine o'clock and when they turned it into a Super Center a lot of people in Bovary thought that no good would come of it , encouraging people to stay up all night . Americans go to bed early and get up early , my daddy said . But I have trouble sleeping sometimes . I live in the old trailer park out the state highway and it 's not too far from the Wal-Mart and I live there with my yellow cat Eddie . I am forty years old and I was married once , to a telephone installer who fell in love with cable TV . There 's no cable TV in Bovary yet , though with a twenty-four-hour Wal-Mart , it 's probably not too far behind . It wo n't come soon enough to save my marriage , however . Not that I wanted it to . He told me he just had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he was going away for good to Mobile and he did n't want me to go with him , this was the end for us , and I was understanding the parts about it being the end but he was going on about fiber optics and things that I did n't really follow . So I said fine and he went away , and even if he 'd wanted me to go with him , I would n't have done it . I 've only been to Mobile a couple of times and I did n't take to it . Bovary is just right for me . At least that 's what I thought when it had to do with my ex-husband , and that kind of thinking just stayed with me , like a grape-juice stain on your housedress , and I am full of regrets , I can tell you , for not rethinking that whole thing before this . But I got a job at a hairdresser 's in town and Daddy bought me the trailer free and clear and me and Eddie moved in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I met Desi in the parking lot . I called him that because he talked with a funny accent but I liked him . I had my insomnia and it was about three in the morning and I went to the twenty-four-hour Wal-Mart and I was glad it was there and it was open -- I 'd tell that right to the face of anybody in this town -- I was glad for a place to go when I could n't sleep . So I was coming out of the store with a bag that had a little fuzzy mouse toy for Eddie , made of rabbit fur , I 'm afraid , and that strikes me as pretty odd to kill all those cute little rabbits , which some people have as pets and love a lot , so that somebody else 's pet of a different type can have something to play with , and it 's that kind of odd thing that makes you shake your head about the way life is lived on planet Earth -- Desi has helped me see things in the larger perspective -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me from buying the furry cat toy , because Eddie does love those things . Maybe today I would n't do the same , but I was n't so enlightened that night when I came out of the Wal-Mart and I had that toy and some bread and baloney and a refrigerator magnet , which I collect , of a zebra head . <p> He was standing out in the middle of the parking lot and he was n't moving . He was just standing still as a cow and there was n't any car within a hundred feet of him , and , of course , his spaceship was n't anywhere in sight , though I was n't looking for that right away because at first glance I did n't know he was a spaceman . He was wearing a long black trench coat with the belt cinched tight and he had a black felt hat with a wide brim . Those were the things I saw first and he seemed odd , certainly , dressed like that in Bovary , but I took him for a human being , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he was still standing out there and I called out to him , " Are you lost ? " <p> His head turns my way and I still ca n't see him much at all except as a hat and a coat . <p> " Did you forget where you parked your car ? " I say , and then right away I realize there is n't but about four cars total in the parking lot at that hour . So I put the bag with my things in the seat and I come around the back of the car and go a few steps toward him . I feel bad . So I call to him , kind of loud because I 'm still pretty far away from him and also because I already have a feeling he might be a foreigner . I say , " I was n't meaning to be snippy , because that 's something that happens to me a lot and I can look just like you look sometimes , I 'm sure , standing in the lot wondering where I am , exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm moving kind of slow in his direction . He is n't saying anything back and he is n't moving . But already I 'm noticing that his belt is cinched very tight , like he 's got maybe an eighteen-inch waist . And as I get near , he sort of pulls his hat down to hide his face , but already I 'm starting to think he 's a spaceman . <p> I stop . I have n't seen a spaceman before except in the newspaper and I take another quick look around , just in case I missed something , like there might be four cars and a flying saucer . But there 's nothing unusual . Then I think , oh my , there 's one place I have n't looked , and so I lift my eyes , very slow because this is something I do n't want to see all the sudden , and finally I 'm staring into the sky . It 's a dark night and there are a bunch of stars up there and I get goose bumps because I 'm pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is from somewhere out there . But at least there 's no spaceship as big as the Wal-Mart hanging over my head with lights blinking and transporter beams ready to shine down on me . It 's only stars . <p> So I bring my eyes down -- just about as slow -- to look at this man . He 's still there . And in the shadow of his hat brim , with the orangey light of the parking lot all around , I can see these eyes looking at me now and they are each of them about as big as Eddie 's whole head and shaped kind of like Eddie 's eyes . <p> " Are you a spaceman ? " I just say this right out . <p> " Yes , ma'am , " he says and his courtesy puts me at ease right away . Americans are courteous , my daddy says , not like your Eastern liberal New York taxi drivers . <p> " They have n't gone and abandoned you , have they , your friends or whoever ? " I say . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice is kind of high-pitched and he has this accent , but it 's more in the tone of the voice than how he says his words , like he 's talking with a mouth full of grits or something . <p> " You looked kind of lost , is all . " <p> " I am waiting , " he says . <p> " That 's nice . They 'll be along soon , probably , " I say , and I feel my feet starting to slide back in the direction of the car . There 's only so far that courtesy can go in calming you down . The return of the spaceship is something I figure I can do without . <p> Then he says , " I am waiting for you , Edna Bradshaw . " <p> " Oh . Good . Sure , honey . That 's me . I 'm Edna . Yes . Waiting for me . " I 'm starting to babble and I 'm hearing myself like I was hovering in the air over me and I 'm wanting my feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altogether . I wonder if it 's because of some tractor beam or something . Then I wonder if they have tractor beam pulling contests in outer space that they show on TV back in these other solar systems . I figure I 'm starting to get hysterical , thinking things like that in a situation like this , but there 's not much I can do about it . <p> He seems to know I 'm struggling . He takes a tiny little step forward and his hand goes up to his hat , like he 's going to take it off and hold it in front of him as he talks to me , another courtesy that even my daddy would appreciate . But his hand stops . I think he 's not ready to show me his whole spaceman head . He knows it would just make things worse . His hand is bad enough , hanging there over his hat . It 's got little round pads at the end of the fingers , like a gecko , and I do n't stop to count them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of them . <p> His hand comes back down . " I do not hurt you , Edna Bradshaw , I am a friendly guy . " <p> " Good , " I say . " Good . I figured that was so when I first saw you . Of course , you can just figure somebody around here is going to be friendly . That 's a good thing about Bovary , Alabama -- that 's where you are , you know , though you probably do know that , though maybe not . Do you know that ? " <p> He does n't say anything for a moment . I 'm rattling on again , and it 's true I 'm a little bit scared and that 's why , but it 's also true that I 'm suddenly very sad about sounding like this to him , I 'm getting some perspective on myself through his big old eyes , and I 'm sad I 'm making a bad impression because I want him to like me . He 's sweet , really . Very courteous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . <p> " Excuse me , " he says . " I have been translating . You speak many words , Edna Bradshaw . Yes , I know the name of this place . " <p> " I 'm sorry . I just do that sometimes , talk a lot . Like when I get scared , which I am a little bit right now . And call me Edna . " <p> " Please , " he says , " I am calling you Edna already . And in conclusion , you have no reason to be afraid . " <p> " I mean call me just Edna . You do n't have to say Bradshaw every time , though my granddaddy would do that with people . He was a fountain pen salesman and he would say to people , I 'm William D. Bradshaw . Call me William D. Bradshaw . And he meant it . He wanted you to say the whole name every time . But you can just call me Edna . " <p> So the spaceman takes a step forward and my heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from fright , I realize , though it 's some of that . " Edna , " he says . " You are still afraid . " <p> " Telling you about my granddaddy , you mean ? How that 's not really the point here ? Well , yes , I guess so . Sometimes , if he knew you for awhile , he 'd let you call him W.D . Bradshaw . " <p> Now his hand comes up and it clutches the hat and the hat comes off and there he stands in the orange lights of the parking lot at three in the morning in my little old hometown and he does n't have a hair on his head , though I 've always liked bald men and I 've read they 're bald because they have so much male hormone in them , which makes them the best lovers , which would make this spaceman quite a guy , I think , and his head is pointy , kind of , and his cheeks are sunken and his cheekbones are real clear and I 'm thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or something , just last week I got a prize-winning recipe off a can of cooking spray that looks like it 'd put flesh on a fence post . And , of course , there are these big eyes of his and he blinks once , real slow , and I think it 's because he 's got a strong feeling in him , and he says , " Edna , my name is hard for you to say . " <p> And I think of Desi right away , and I try it on him , and his mouth , which has n't got anything that look like lips exactly , moves up at the edges and he makes this pretty smile . <p> " I have heard that name , " he says . " Call me Desi . And I am waiting for you , Edna , because I study this planet and I hear you speak many words to your friends and to your subspecies companion and I detect some bright-colored aura around you and I want to meet you . " <p> " That 's good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blush starting in my chest , where it always starts , and it 's spreading up my throat and into my cheeks . <p> " I would like to call on you tomorrow evening , if I have your permission , " he says . <p> " Boy , " I say . " Do a lot of people have the wrong idea about spacemen . I thought you just grabbed somebody and beamed them up and that was it . " It was a stupid thing to say , I realize right away . I think Desi looks a little sad to hear this . The corners of his mouth sink . " I 'm sorry , " I say . <p> " No , " he says . " This is how we are perceived , it is true . You speak only the truth . This is one reason I want to meet you , Edna . You seem always to say what is inside your head without any attempt to alter it . " <p> Now it 's my turn to look a little sad , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a chance to find out that Desi is more than courteous . His hands come out toward me at once , the little suckers on them primed to latch onto me , and I 'm not even scared because I know it means he cares about me . And he 's too refined to touch me this quick . His hands just hang there between us and he says , " I speak this not as a researcher but as a male creature of a parallel species . " <p> " You mean as a man ? " <p> His eyes blink again , teal slow . " Yes . As a man . As a man I try to say that I like the way you speak . " <p> So I give him permission to call on me and he thanks me and he turns and glides away . I know his legs are moving but he glides , real smooth , across the parking lot and I can see now that poor Desi did n't even find a pair of pants and some shoes to go with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a frog 's and his feet look a lot like his hands . But all that is unclear on the first night . He has disappeared out into the darkness and I drive on home to my subspecies companion and I tell him all about what happened while he purrs in my lap and I have two thoughts . <p> First , if you 've never seen a cat in your entire life or anything like one and then meet a cat in a Wal-Mart parking lot in the middle of the night all covered with fur and making this rumbling noise and maybe even smelling of mouse meat , you 'd have to make some serious adjustments to what you think is pretty and sweet and something you can call your own . Second -- and this hits me with a little shock -- Desi says he 's been hearing how I talk to my friends and even to Eddie , and that sure was n't by hanging around in his trench coat and blending in with the furniture . Of course , if you 've got a spaceship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's not so surprising you 've got some kind of radio or something that lets you listen to what everybody 's saying without being there . <p> And when I think of this , I start to sing for Desi . I just sit for a long while where I am , with Eddie in my lap , this odd little creature that does n't look like me at all but who I find cute as can be and who I love a lot , and I sing , because when I was a teenager I had a pretty good voice and I even thought I might be a singer of some kind , though there was n't much call for that in Bovary except in the church choir , which is where I sang mostly , but I loved to sing other kinds of songs too . And so I say real loud , " This is for you , Desi . " And then I sing every song I can think of . I sing " The Long and Winding Road " and " Lucy in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a bunch of others , some twice , like " The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face . " Then I do a Reba McEntire medley and I start with " Is There Life Out There " and then I do " Love Will Find Its Way to You " and " Up to Heaven " and " Long Distance Lover . " I sing my heart out to Desi and I have to say this surprises me a little but maybe it should n't because already I 'm hearing myself through his ears -- though at that moment I ca n't even say for sure if he had ears -- and I realize that a lot of what I say , I say because it keeps me from feeling so lonely . <p> The next night there 's a knock on my door and I 'm wearing my best dress , with a scoop neck and it shows my cleavage pretty good and on the way to the door I suddenly doubt myself . I do n't know if spacemen are like earthmen in that way or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knockers , especially if their women are as skinny as Desi . But I am who I am . So I put all that out of my mind and I open the door and there he is . He 's got his black felt hat on , pulled down low in case any of my neighbors are watching , I figure , and he 's wearing a gray pinstripe suit that 's way too big for him and a white shirt and a tie with a design that 's dozens of little Tabasco bottles floating around . <p> " Oh , " I say . " You like hot food ? " <p> This makes him stop and try to translate . <p> " Your tie , " I say . " Do n't you know about your tie ? " <p> He looks down and lifts the end of the tie and looks at it for a little while and he is so cute doing that and so innocent-like that my heart is doing flips and I kind of wiggle in my dress a bit to make him look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the women on his planet are skinny , then he could be real real ready for a woman like me . That 's how I figure it as I 'm waiting there for him to check out his tie and be done with it , though I know it 's my own fault for getting him off on that track , and me doing that is just another example of something or other . <p> Then Desi looks up at me , and he takes off his hat with one hand and I see that he does n't have anything that looks like ears , really , just sort of a little dip on each side where ears might be . But that does n't make him so odd . What 's an ear mean , really ? Having an ear or not having an ear wo n't get you to heaven , it seems to me . I look into Desi 's big dark eyes and he blinks slow and then his other hand comes out from behind his back and he 's got a flower for me that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know what , a blue kind of , a red kind of , and I know this is a spaceflower of some sort and I take it from him and it weighs about as much as my Sunbeam Steam Iron , just this one flower . <p> He says , " I heard you sing for me , " and he holds out his hand . If you want to know an exact count , there 's eight fingers on each hand , I will end up counting them carefully later on our date , but for now there 's still just a lot of fingers and I realize I 'm not afraid of them anymore and I reach out to him and the little suckers latch on all over my hand , top and bottom , and it 's like he 's kissing me in eight different places there , over and over , they hold on to me and they pulse in each spot they touch , maybe with the beat of his heart . It 's like that . And my eyes fill up with tears because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I know . <p> And then he leads me to his flying saucer , which is pretty big but not as big as I imagined , not as big as all of Wal-Mart , certainly , maybe just the pharmacy and housewares departments put together . It 's parked out in the empty field back of my trailer where they kept saying they 'd put in a miniature golf course and they never did and you do n't even see the saucer till you 're right up against it , it blends in with the night , and you 'd think if they can make this machine , they could get him a better suit . Then he says , " You are safe with me , Edna Bradshaw daughter of Joseph R. Bradshaw and granddaughter of William D. Bradshaw . " <p> It later turns out these family things are important where he 's from but I say to him , " William D. is dead , I only have his favorite fountain pen in a drawer somewhere , it 's very beautiful , it 's gold and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you should forget about Joseph R. for the time being because I 'm afraid you and my daddy are n't going to hit it off real well and I just as soon not think about that till I have to . " <p> Then Desi smiles at me and it 's because of all those words , and especially me talking so blunt about my daddy , and I guess also about my taking time to tell him about the beautiful fountain pen my granddaddy left for me , but there 's reasons I talk like this , I guess , and Desi says he came to like me from hearing me talk . <p> Listen to me even now . I 'm trying to tell this story of Desi and me and I ca n't help myself going on about every little thing . But the reasons are always the same , and it 's true I 'm lonely again . And it 's true I 'm scared again because I 've been a fool . <p> Desi took me off in his spaceship and we went out past the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look back and I wanted to try to figure out where Bovary was but I had n't even found the USA when everything got blurry and before you know it we were way out in the middle of nowhere , out in space , and I could n't see the sun or the moon or anything close up , except all the stars were very bright , and I 'm not sure whether we were moving or not because there was nothing close enough by to tell , but I think we were parked , like this was the spaceman 's version of the dead end road to the rock quarry , where I kissed my first boy . I turned to Desi and he turned to me and I should 've been scared but I was n't . Desi 's little suckers were kissing away at my hand and then we were kissing on the lip except he did n't have any but it did n't make any difference because his mouth was soft and warm and smelled sweet , like Binaca breath spray , and I wondered if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Binaca that they have on his planet as well . <p> Then he took me back to his little room on the spaceship and we sat on things like beanbag chairs and we talked a long time about what life in Bovary is like and what life on his planet is like . Desi is a research scientist , you see . He thinks that the only way for our two peoples to learn about each other is to meet and to talk and so forth . There are others where he lives that think it 's best just to use their machines to listen in and do their research like that , on the sly . There are even a bunch of guys back there who say forget the whole thing , leave them to hell alone . Let everybody stick to their own place . And I told Desi that my daddy would certainly agree with the **25;195;TOOLONG guys from his planet , but I agreed with him . <p> It was all very interesting and very nice , but I was starting to get a little sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this thing we 're doing here like research ? You asked me out as part of a scientific study ? I was called by the Gallup Poll people once and I do n't remember what it was about but I answered ' none of the above ' and ' other ' to every question . " <p> For all the honesty Desi said he admired in me , I sure know it was n't anything to do with my answers to a Gallup Poll that was bothering me , but there I was , bogged down in all of that , and that 's a kind of dishonesty , it seems to me now . <p> But he knew what I was worried about . " No , Edna , " he says . " There are many on my planet who would be critical of me . They would say this is why we should have no contact at all with your world . Things like this might happen . " <p> He pauses right there and as far as I know he does n't have anything to translate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say , " Things like what ? " <p> Then both his hands take both my hands and when you 've got sixteen cute little suckers going at you , it 's hard to make any real tough self-denying kind of decisions and that 's when I end up with a bona fide spaceman lover . And enough said , as we like to end touchy conversations around the hairdressing parlor , except I will tell you that he was bald all over and it 's true what they say about bald men . <p> Then he takes me to the place where he picked the flower . A moon of some planet or other and there 's only these flowers growing as far as the eye can see in all directions and there are clouds in the sky and they are the color of Eddie 's turds after a can of Nine Lives Crab and Tuna , which just goes to show that even in some far place in another solar system you ca n't have everything . But maybe Desi likes those clouds and maybe I 'd see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have that chance now , though I could 've , it 's my own damn fault , and if I 've been sounding a little bit hit and miss and here and there in the way I 've been telling all this , it 's now you find out why . <p> Desi and I stand in that field of flowers for a long while , his little suckers going up and down my arm and all over my throat and chest , too , because I can tell you that a spaceman does too appreciate a woman who has some flesh on her , especially in the right places , but he also appreciates a woman who will speak her mind . And I was standing there wondering if I should tell him about those clouds or if I should just keep my eyes on the flowers and my mouth shut . Then he says , " Edna , it is time to go . " <p> So he takes my hand and we go back into his spaceship and he 's real quiet all the sudden and so am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end . Then before you know it , there 's the earth right in front of me and it 's looking , even out there , pretty good , pretty much like where I should be , like my own flower box and my own propane tank and my own front Dutch door look when I drive home at night from work . <p> Then we are in the field behind the house and it seems awful early in the evening for as much as we 've done , and later on I discover it 's like two weeks later and Desi had some other spaceman come and feed Eddie while we were gone , though he should have told me because I might 've been in trouble at the hairdressing salon , except they believed me pretty quick when I said a spaceman had taken me off , because that 's what they 'd sort of come around to thinking themselves after my being gone without a trace for two weeks and they wanted me to tell the newspaper about it because I might get some money for it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though my daddy says it 's only American to make money any way you can , but I 'm not that American , it seems to me , especially if my daddy is right about what American is , which I suspect he 's not . <p> What I 'm trying to say is that Desi stopped in this other field with me , this planet-earth field with plowed up ground and witchgrass all around and the smell of early summer in Alabama , which is pretty nice , and the sound of cicadas sawing away in the trees and something like a kind of hum out on the horizon , a nighttime sound I listen to once in a while and it makes me feel like a train whistle in the distance makes me feel , which I also listen for , especially when I 'm lying awake with my insomnia and Eddie is sleeping near me , and that hum out there in the distance is all the wide world going about its business and that 's good but it makes me glad I 'm in my little trailer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll see on the street the next morning . <p> And in the middle of a field full of all that , what was I to say when Desi took my hand and asked me to go away with him> He said , " I have to return to my home planet now and after that go off to other worlds . I am being transferred and will not be back here . But Edna , we feel love on my planet just like you do here . That is why I know it is right that we learn to speak to each other , your people and mine . And in conclusion , I love you , Edna Bradshaw . I want you to come away with me and be with me forever . " <p> How many chances do you have to be happy ? I did n't even want to go to Mobile , though I was n't asked , that 's true enough , and I would n't have been happy there anyway . So that does n't count as a blown chance . But this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? How could I be happy in a distant galaxy ? These were questions that I had to answer right away , out in the smell of an Alabama summer with my cat waiting for me , though I 'm sure he could 've gone with us , that was n't the issue , and with my daddy living just on the other side of town , though , to tell the truth , I would n't miss him much , the good Lord forgive me for that sentiment , and I did love my spaceman , I knew that , and I still do , I love his wiggly hairless shy courteous smart-as-a-whip self . But there 's only so many new things a person can take in at once and I 'd about reached my limit on that night . <p> So I heard myself say , " I love you too , Desi . But I ca n't leave the planet Earth . I ca n't even leave Bovary . " <p> That 's about all I could say . And Desi did n't put up a fuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , though now I wish to God he 'd tried , at least tried , and maybe he could 've done it , ' cause I could hear myself saying these words like it was n't me speaking , like I was standing off a ways just listening in . But my spaceman was shy from the first time I saw him . And I guess he just did n't have it in him to argue with me , once he felt I 'd rejected him . <p> That 's the way the girls at the hairdressing salon see it . <p> I guess they 're right . I guess they 're right , too , about telling the newspaper my story . Maybe some other spaceman would read it , somebody from Desi 's planet , and maybe Desi 's been talking about me and maybe he 'll hear about how miserable I am now and maybe I can find him or he can find me . <p> Because I am miserable . I have n't even gone near my daddy for a few months now . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I get real angry at them , for some reason . Still , I stay right where I am . I guess now it 's because it 's the only place he could ever find me , if he wanted to . I go out into the field back of my trailer at night and I walk all around it , over and over , each night , I walk around and around under the stars because a spaceship only comes in the night and you ca n't even see it until you get right up next to it . <p> 
##1003656 MY MASTER 'S TEMPER were by spasms choleric , the spasms exacerbated by trespass , real or fancied , of his slaves , all of whom had had occasion to beg their fellows daub their backs with salve of rum and lard . Yet Dufay had raised up drivers to lash the hands to work , drivers on whom he palmed off most of the stewardship , that he might dedicate himself to advancement of universal knowledge . In sun and rain he tramped , far from the carries where his hands labored , peering under leaves , down burrows and up into nests to discover and name what creatures inhabited the wilderness parts of his domain . <p> An excellent draftsman , he delighted in sketching particulars of feather , fur and scale ; the curve of claws , of teeth and beaks ; the depths of eyes ; the stretch and shove of limbs . On sketching expeditions to the rockiest , most surf-pounded tips of St. Michel , he spied from blinds he had had constructed on narrow ledges , to watch the sea birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spied on the slaves , yes , on his own wife and children , in like manner , but I never saw him loiter in the shadows of human habitation . ) <p> From the age of five , I , PIERRE-BAPTISTE , whom the whites called Goody , had been laboring in the carries , coughing from the fire that burned off the leaves , stepping and stooping to chop the canes and singing between my gritted teeth to keep the bone-grinding pace . One day , M'sieu was riding his mare past the gang , his cockaded hat abob on Yolande 's trot as he passed on his way to more tangled parts of our isle to sketch . His old servant trotted behind , one Christophe , called Long-Shanks , carrying the tools of his master 's art . Alas , this wornout soul , Christophe , keeled over . Without further adieu , he gave up the ghost and died . <p> " Hop to ! Do you not leave Long-Shanks asprawl to be chewed by dogs , " said M'sieu . " Yet let me have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait on me at once , not again the tapered wrists of an aging yellow too refined to lift . " And , rueful , he doffed his hat to Christophe . <p> PIERRE was called from the gang then , to lay down his bill and serve the master as porter . Wriggling joyful I was , who had no notion what a world of fetching made a body servant 's work ! Though I was then a strapping youth of ten , they had not yet given me a pair of pants . So , on the first day I turned my eyes from the cane to follow Yolande 's tail , I did not look around me much , but only mulled over one single question : Would I get a pair of drawers ? And when I did , that very eve , and not coarse Osnaburg , but silk , however faded , I strutted like a cock , and capered to the piping of the cane flute , the first capers I had cut in a very long time , for my smock had ceased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrink and cower over Johnny Fish . <p> Yet the drawers they had given me were pantaloons from years before , very baggy and covered with tufted ribbon loops . And these stale fancies gave great merriment to Pamphile , the master 's son , and his stepmother , who swore they would grow my frizz to a full-bottom -- " he would need no curling iron , and his nits would lose themselves in the maze " -- and send me over the seas to court , to wait on the jades that yawned around the King . And they conceived a plot , to give me a name of antiquity , like a hero 's in a tragedy , but M'sieu stamped his foot and swore , " I 'll be damned if I learn a new name I must remember in the bush when I call on him to set a snare . " <p> At night , in the dark , I lay with the fancy pants on my bed . With my fingers I tugged at the fall , so it tore , and , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what company was around . <p> " The stuff be so old it has rotted , " I allowed . <p> So they gave me some drawers more plain and recent . <p> Once I was decently covered , I straightened my back and willingly shouldered the master 's easel . I looked about me smartly , as he enjoined me over Yolande 's withers , " Observe the curious cunning with which Nature has devised the creatures . " <p> Dutifully , at first , I gaped at the mole , all fur and snout , with shovelly hands , that blindly hunches and wriggles a path like an endless pant leg to inhabit . How came he to St. Michel ? Did he tunnel under the sea ? Or was he pushing like a hungry root at Creation ? <p> The island had not the variety of creatures , allowed M'sieu , that are known on the continents ; yet creatures there were sufficient to preoccupy an inquiring philosopher , most particularly species of lizard and bird . And soon enough Pierre began to observe for the pleasure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green throat of one small lizard , puffed like a lady 's coyly dropped handkerchief , as the creature took the sun . All languor he lolled till he cast his tongue to snag a fly ! Servant no less than master marveled at the parakeets , their feathers brighter than flowers , cleaning themselves with their toes and hooking with their beaks the mites , smaller than lice , that inhabited the feathers ' underbrush . <p> And the white egret , and in season , the blue heron . <p> Then there were fishes , more multivarious than birds , a garden of flesh in the waters , impossible to catch and hold , their form their movement , their movement one with the water they had their being in , the salty tear-drenched garden of the dead my godmothers had told me of , where I did not want to linger , though I ate any fish my elders caught , for I knew they took the fish with gratitude , and were forgiven . <p> The master did not trust the waters any more than I , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeds , waiting their time . Yet Dufay would not take off his shoes to wet his feet in the sea , let alone remove his clothes to wet his person . He did not like it , that was all ; he did not care for it , so he said . ' T was a slimy , endless chaos , he did not want it to impinge on his person . <p> Still , he must have fish to sketch and paint , if his natural history were to be complete . So it fell to me to catch these fish , yet without spoiling their form . So I must into the sea . If I would not do it , he would send me back to the fields . Yet I knew not how to comport myself in the sea . Nor did my master , yet he would teach me , by hypothesis , trying one expedient then another . <p> First , he had me dangled as bait on a rope he tied to a pole held by two very big men . And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I learned to hold my breath . And he bade me agitate my arms and legs , like a human mill , and thus make myself an engine for motion in the sea . And when he saw my terrors had eased , he bade the two men throw me in , without the rope or the pole , so I must save myself with the motions I had learned . And in this manner I was trained to be nimble in the sea , to capture the fishes Dufay would sketch . <p> As I must paddle about with a spear in one hand , so I must keep the other , and both my legs , in motion , as an ox on a treadmill , to churn myself afloat . Yet -- could I quiet my heart that pounded loud in my ears as depths rose to claim me , could I bring myself to open my eyes -- then I saw , not the flesh-shrouded bones of the dead , but a paradise shimmering in veils of light . Surely the dead must be at peace in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgiven for plucking blossoms of flesh , not to eat , but for M'sieu to paint . Yet , the longer I spent in the garden of the dead , the less fearsome seemed the prospect of death . Was I not floating in a bliss that laved me , luxuriant and enjoyable ? So Pierre splashed among his ancestors ' souls , visible only as movement in water , and he celebrated their sweet repose , free of the whites who feared to set foot in their domain . Seeing how Pierre smiled when he rose for breath , the master clapped his hands and patted his slaveman 's head . <p> " Good Goody , " he said . " Good boy . Do you fetch me the fish , one by one , I will capture their likenesses . " <p> Alas ! Though I popped to the surface with a speared fish for him to sketch , or even a live one , squirming to escape and smothering in air , there was no way to capture the gracile essence save by immersion . So much the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did not revere the fish , and his stiff fillets , dull eyes already rotting , were not his truest portraits . He never even saw the hermaphrodite plants , with thick stalks and bright-petaled flowers , yet with roots emerging from the calyx , squirming and grasping at tiny fish , which they did feed into the calyx as hands would stuff a mouth . For M'sieu did not believe Pierre when Pierre spoke of them , and offered to bring one up , though it might be a pet of the dead . M'sieu did not believe a slaveman could discover creatures a master had not . " Tut tut ! " he said . <p> And it was not just the underwater creatures M'sieu so blindly eschewed . For he took apolectic fits at the sight of certain vermin , viz. , the legions of rats that encamped in his fields to commandeer cane . Monsieur refused to limn them , though most assuredly they be " principal fauna . " And I do suspect they are as dear to their Creator as any other creature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , assuredly not when friends came to dine , but for a family dinner . Why not ? The creatures have fed on sugar ; their flesh is sweet . And as they eat so much of our crop , to eat them in turn is a sensible economy . Yet our Monsieur forebore this dainty for himself and his ; the old mistress -- the first one , the haughty and pious -- sent the slave-children into the fields , to hunt and catch the rats , that at very little cost to the whites we slaves might daily dine on flesh , and so keep up our strength , without our sweat smelling fishy , or any expense for pork or beef . At the same time , we would help to save the crop . <p> This scheme fermented among us great bubbles of resentment -- we to eat what the whites refuse as unfit ? Our people left the vermin corpses for pigs , preferring to feed our strength with fish leaping fresh to the net , the gift of death to life , and so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we hung that mistress in effigy , her figure sewed of sacking stuff , with a block of wood for a missal in her paw . This straw mistress we roasted above our bonfire . When she burned , she gave out a satisfying , piteous plaint , for we had filled her body with rats and mice . <p> No more than pilfering vermin or invading insects were we slaves to be discovered in M'sieu 's chaste pencil-and-chalks or his fastidious ink-washes , unless we be those dim , tiny , bent figures seen from afar in rippling fields of cane . Front and center the feathered creatures , most especially those of a gaudy and brilliant plumage and distinguished profile , with warrior 's crest and aquiline beak . Dearer to Pierre the drab pelican , its beak a belly of fish , and after the pelican , among featherless creatures , the crab that skulked in the brush , till , spying an enshelled slime shuck off his outgrown house , Sergeant Crab nipped in to occupy . How quaint to see patrolling crabs reconnoiter tunnelish paths through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Were these the army of maroons , the runaway slaves the grown-ups spoke of in whispers ? <p> In time the habits of pirate crabs seemed no less strange than the CHARACTER OF M'SIEU himself . For though he deemed himself a well-bred man , he observed no niceties of deportment or dress . Indeed , by the time he threw me his breeches , they were out at the knee , his coat tattered streamers , so I would rather get my clothes , of lesser stuff , from the captain of the drivers , Master Squint , of whom more later . But as for M'sieu , he forgot to close up his fall when he pissed . When his servant was slow , and he took a fit of pique and dressed himself , he rolled one stocking over his breeches , buckled his cuff over the other . He consistently forgot to wind the watch he carried on a chain and ignored the beating of the dinner gong . <p> When his brother 's agents came from France , he bade me shave his head , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him more than once . He would not pay a barber , you see . Yet over his wounds , his full-bottom snugged his head most accommodating , so he might have cut a good figure had he not dragged from his fraying cuff a huge nasty rag to wipe his nose after pinching snuff . And those come from France remarked , he had lost the habit of bowing , though surely he must have had it once . <p> He never took a man 's hand nor kissed a lady 's , but only nodded absently when presented -- did I say " kiss a lady " ? When sober , he fondled neither maids nor men and eschewed intrigues , though when he had drunk himself sodden amidst a crush of planters he indulged in the jovial pinch . And now and then took a woman without ceremony , as a dog smelling rut , and so had fathered a brat or two in the yard . <p> His visitors returned to France , his wig gathered dust on a stand , the hair of his head pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a depraved monk , so devilish wild he must wear his nightcap even on the steamiest nights so as not to fright the maids . Yet there were worse . <p> Had he kept his counsel , he might have been a tolerable master , save he exacted from those he lorded it over punctilios he himself foreswore . Madame , his second young wife -- the first had died in a fluxy sweat -- he bade dress and speak as a queen , though she minced through the pantry fearful of scorpions . Badgering the maids to scrape the mold off hanging meat , she must wear three sleeve flounces , and a sack , and a useless apron of lace , and a pinner with trailing lappets . She must be rouged and powdered , and patched and plucked , and teeter on high heels , her head dressed out with false curls . She must embroider perfect lilies on the household linens and read the scriptures every day as befitted a lady who , though born in these islands , had been schooled in a convent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch her with her sleeves rolled , calling her " Rogue " and lambasting her as a slavey . <p> POOR MADAME ! She struck false notes on the pianoforte , the keys of which the air 's moistness had swollen from tune . Her thread often tangled as she passed and repassed her needle . M'sieu then pined for a wife who knew what to do with the keys at her waist . Indeed children tittered in their sleeves as she passed with her nose in the air . And though she could crack those keys on a servant 's skull , the smell of meat that had hung too long could not be masked with spice and wine . Yet again the bread was not too stale for willful jaw to crack ! It is true that stuffing poked from the chairs , but M'sieu himself had scored the silk with the rowels of his spurs , neglecting to call for his boots taken off . <p> If M'sieu 's wife were buffeted by his fits of discontent , consider : his slaves were entirely at his mercy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his hands did marvel at his master 's alternation between three states : the first , a profound , faithful and innocent regard for the animals he observed ; the second , an absentminded , brisk accord with his fellow human beings , including myself ; the third , a sudden and violent animosity toward all Creation , which consumed his bandy-legged , potbellied person and laid waste roundabout . Was the tyrant who snapped his quills and tore his paper the same who stood so still to lure a lizard the tomtits lit on his head ? In his rages he caned me and whipped me , yet still I pitied him . For , though a slave , I did live within myself a free man , master ; M'sieu the converse . <p> Yet HIS DRAWINGS were all control , more exact than Nature herself had been , so scrupulously did he render the shape of each lineament , each color shade or tint , each hillock and valley of musculature and quirk of physiognomy , so exactly did he capture the needle-prick stare of the hawk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose delicate and whiskery deliberations he forgave its resemblance to the loathed rat . <p> Yes , and the thorny brush , the bent of which reveals the wind ; the smoke tree 's haze of ground twigs ; the monstrous hairy sour-sap fruit ; the manchineel with its blistering milk , its horrible charmy apples -- ah , First Woman ! -- the amaranth , center stalks a fountain of blood ; the rocks and the stones , earth with its packings and crumblings , yes , so truly did M'sieu draw all these , so meticulously paint , with such accurately mix't colors , one might have thought him a devil , tempting poor sinners , take one hesitant , fateful step into the world of his creation , a world seeming purer than our own , in which each creature , nay each rock , turns always for inspection , if not its best side , then at least that side most expressing its essence . <p> The purity came from this effect : though Monsieur did limn the animals precisely in all proportions and attributes , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dapple of light , revealed and covered them . Were I to judge from the plates in books , the rendering of shadow , velvet and dense or hazy and dim , does give to the painted world its appearance of movement , suggesting alternation of day and night , and hence the round of seasons , the progress through shift and transformation to death , and thence to life again , from which no man can escape . Yet in the works of M'sieu , Creation is suffused in a pure , bright , even light , as if all creatures were light-struck cripples , caught in the terrible stillness before the palsy strikes , the storm breaks , the lava flows , caught in this moment as in Eternity , not the eternity of paradise , earned by the good , but a terrible stasis , the paralysis of Sun 's merciless glare . Ah , what be any man but damned who casts no shadow ? Shadow , shadow , the dark blot of being , stain of the blood waters , deep and heavy and old , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ashes drenching our bones . We who casts no shadow , is he not unquiet in quiet forever , dead in life and live in death ? Here is the paradox of the art of Dufay . Yet this be heady stuff , this paradox , argued in a vacuum tube , in the hand of Baron Skull , with the mercury long since run out . <p> In one other more mundane particular the art of M'sieu lacks verisimilitude : in the vine-swagged jungles that climb the mountainsides ; in the groves of mango and orange trees , flaunting their gauds of fruit ; among the tidy coffee trees ; the cutlass-leaved bananas ; the feathery palms ; deep in the cane carries ' green and landlocked sea , the island of St. Michel where abides Pierre be festooned with a florid plant called orchid , which displays itself in sun and shade , windward and leeward , high and low . M'sieu would not draw the brown-bagged blossoms , and cursed and stamped if he found but a grain of the pollen on his sleeve , calling for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AH ! If Buffon had come out from France , he would have seen in what respects his natural history of these islands be incomplete . Yet many an artful work was sent to France for engraving , and Pierre vaunted himself , he served a worthwhile master , though sorely the master tried his servant . <p> Those of HIS FINISHED WORKS M'sieu cherished too greatly to send forth , he locked in his old campaign chest , with several tattered standards and a sword he had worn in battles with Protestants before he came out to the Anduves . There in his chest he supposed his oeuvre would be safe from theft or spite or the depradations of rats or of armies . Alas ! The chest was not close-fitted . In the leathern interior damp took hold and bred up slimes to soften the paper , spoil the colors and blur the exact outlines of the images . This I discovered one evening in a damp season when the company sat till midnight smoking pipes and drinking toasts from a bowl of fired brandy . Forsooth , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To cool the rebellious heat that rose in my head with the fumes of the burnt brandy the dissipates imbibed , I ventured into the keeping room to pick the lock of the campaign chest , as oft I did , for the sole purpose of examining , however furtively and briefly , the pictures and notes stored within , to renew my sense of my master 's worth . <p> And what a putrefaction did I spy and smell ! From the pigments on his pages there bloomed a terrible colony of proliferating , stunted monsters , regiments of blue and green and white spoilers , obliterating the limpid symmetries of M'sieu 's vision , as if creatures of shadow and orchid-dust mites , obscure vermin and hermaphrodite flora-fauna he had refused to draw , had vengefully mingled their juices and their rage , and given birth to generations of vileness so wicked their stench was worse than death . All was rotting , beyond rotting , and would soon be lost altogether , as I pray my own pages , in their careful confinement , will not . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might fly from his trunk into the world , a greater plague than Pandora set free , and without any mitigating hope . <p> To stifle the slimy creatures , I hastily doused the oeuvre in a dusty particulate reserved for the wigs , which did whiten those heads and smother nits and might , the Gods be willing , sweeten the moldering pages in the chest . This good powder did possess a most pleasing scent , mixed of many magical essences of the several flowers of France , compounded with musk and orris root , It did indeed seem to stifle the odor like rancid cheese and stale piss that soured the chest . Yet before the slimes could flee the carnage , PIERRE relocked the chest . He sat by it then , guarding against my seepage from under the lid . And he listened for the master 's call . <p> 
##1003657 On the Buka Islands off the coast of New Guinea there has recently been observed an unexplained surge in the population of the genus Ciconia ciconia , commonly known as the Indonesian stork . Not only has each generation greatly outnumbered its predecessors in aggregation , but the newer storks are also found , at maturity , to have surpassed the size and body weight of their progenitors by up to twenty percent , the most recent hatchlings having already , after only one month , far outgrown their patents and achieved a wingspan of 6.4 feet -- an unprecedented length in all previously observed stork populations , including the mammoth South American eagle stork . Scientists have attempted to evaluate all environmental influences , assessing possible fluctuations in water temperature due to industrial activities , tidal disturbances and global warming ; changes in rainfall ; effects of regional nautical and aviation patterns ; et cetera . They have also gathered meticulous data on any and all concurrent variations in adjacent species of both flora and fauna which might affect either the immediate or pandemic terraqueous ecosystem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deplete the minnow and crab populations of their habitual feeding grounds , this has in no way checked their unaccountable growth as they have resorted to expanding their hunting territory , and to incorporating into their previously limited diet various species of insects abundantly available on the island and nearby archipelago . Determining the long-term impact that these kinds of feeding shifts may have on the food web is only one of the many challenges scientists confront as they attempt to address this peculiar circumstance . <p> You are swept up in your own affairs , minding your own business , more or less . Like most people you occasionally have dreams you are flying , sweeping over a vast bucolic countryside of tearing upwards through the layers of earth 's atmosphere at dizzying speeds . Perhaps , like many people , you sometimes experience inexplicable waves of foreboding , a sense that doom is fashioning in the distance like clouds gathering for a storm . <p> After nine months of systematic research the team of two dozen experts -- a group of scientists culled by the Center for International @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this dual phenomenon of accelerated growth and proliferation . The only forthcoming hypothesis was contributed not by one of the team , but by a Swiss ornithologist , Heister Kluute , whose theories about the role of a colony of Austrian goldfinches in the infamous 1979 Haapsalu snapping-turtle crisis has left him largely ignored by the mainstream scientific community . However , in light of his present singular observations pertaining to the stork 's behavior and the widespread desperation for any possible illumination in the face of this obscure biological conundrum , Kluute 's early theoretical works -- namely his idea that the turtle extinction was , in fact , a methodical invasion and extermination orchestrated by an " aberrant cartel " of black-eyed goldfinches -- are now undergoing reevaluation by the community . <p> There is something you have forgotten , a dubious story you were told years ago which has always seemed to be missing an ending . You have outgrown the story and moved on to other , newer stories , many of which you have fabricated for your own entertainment or supposed betterment . You no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kluute 's recent article in Vogelkunde Vierteljahresschrift -- whose publication date was twice pushed back because of threats subsequently linked to Kluute 's ex-wife , socialite Maria Strompe-Kluute -- has caused much controversy . In it Kluute asserts that while the stork 's general behavior may seem standard when it is assessed according to its individual components , the same behaviors , when analysed compositionally , that is , as a series of sequences , will be found to be decidedly abnormal , and he claims , are indicative of extreme anxiety and anger on the part of the birds . The jerky vertical head movement -- commonly referred to as the Ciconi nod -- while normal when the stork is eating or transmitting warnings to the flock , is highly abnormal when it is preceded by grooming and is followed by the " puddle dance , " the widely observed and ( it is agreed ) seemingly ceremonious shaking of water from the left leg . <p> Perhaps you assumed that when the job was done they were gone , disappeared -- dead . This is what you were led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . Implication by omission . But you were lied to , and now your fate is sealed . For eons the mutation lay in waiting , a chromosomal smudge , microscopic , but with the power to release this seething fecundity , furious generation . . . and now you are no longer a child , and a silent explosion is taking place and they are coming back for you , gathering strength to take back what was once theirs , what for ages has been thanklessly received without acknowledgment of the rightful claims , their clear , ultimate entitlement . Their anger is massive ; do not think you can escape . They will find you , will descend in a cloud and snatch you from your life like locusts plucking grain . . . huge cawing mothers , they will swaddle you in white sheets torn from a million bedrooms and sweep your overgrown body into the sky , beyond the clouds to where the air is cold and thin . Sheeted and dangling from a strong , angry bill , you may catch glimpses of kicking suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , spectacles and shoes in free fall , hats drifting on the wind . . . only fragments of the millions of swaying adult bodies swaddled and carried upwards by the labor of majestic wings , wings with the might of revolution , achieving the dream . High above the deepest valleys of the Pacific , surrounded by purposeful flapping , a snowstorm of feathers , you may already be woozy from lack of oxygen when the dropping begins , when the air will fill with dull moans and great cries , the thick cloud finally breaking open , darkening the air with justice . . . . <p> 
##1003658 Sure , hysterically , I guess , I hid out again in the office stockroom so no one would see how I was . How messed up I was . Office air wore me out , every staple , every badly lit , Xerox-fumed breath I took . Since she 'd dumped me I could no longer look at my girlfriend , or anyone , without wincing straight in their face , whenever I passed one of them , the other beautiful record company people , in our tortured fluorescent-lit halls . I browsed and shook in my windowed stockroom , a lost closet crapped over with old , dead cassette tapes and warped albums overlooking fortyfour leaning blue stories of sickening , barely uninhabited air . Death herself breathed right before me on the other side of the glass -- out beyond her , Central Park with its carpet of trees , nearly night way up in Harlem . I put my hand coolly against the window , feeling the wind buffeting , trying to break in and get me . <p> Things were speeding up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like I 'd had some big crisis or anything , but the night before , I 'd slept just miserably , sweating , and woke all raw . Later that morning , on my way to work , I kept thinking the straphangers on the train were too aware of me , panhandlers , businessmen , all of them . I should say screw it , I thought , and go home . Maybe call in sick . But I fumbled around in my pockets , in my coat even , and I could n't find my damn keys . <p> I was so tired . . . for no reason it was starting to feel like one of those mornings that are so impossibly overwhelming , so nerve-wracked , you just want to pick up a gun . I could do something like that , I imagined , if I got thrown one more thing . <p> Around noon or so , I left the stockroom and went back to work . Then I watched as Maria , my moody , fellow tele-representative , walked my way down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wad . We 'd had our dramas , but we had never gotten fully together , and so seeing her stung , I copied things , poisoning my skin with the inky fumes . Words crossed her lips as she saw me , and I sensed a surge of telepathized anger vibrating between us down that hall . Once , I even believed she might go so far as to practice acts of magic or evil spells upon me , she being , they said , a witch . Maria and I 'd had this halfhearted , sick flirtation , gazing at each other in meetings , or side by side , our arms brushing together in lust . Like me , I suppose she just needed to touch someone . <p> As she came nearer , one of my eyelids began jittering wildly-I could hear my pulse , and my lips felt the throbbing hot seed of a herpes sore . My God , I could hardly keep control of my body ! I smiled stupidly , and , ignoring her , turned to my work . I shoved the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my dread , refusing me . Maria came over . She poked at the copier once and it ran . <p> " Sure . Great , " I said . <p> " Stu wants you in the TV room , he said for me to say . " <p> " Yeah . I 'm gone already , " I said . <p> " No , he wants you now , ' he said , " she said . <p> " Wait . I meant like , I 'm there . I 'm gone . . . I 'm going already . " <p> " Huh ? " She dabbed her nose with her wad of tissue , sniffling . " No , now , ' he said . Our commercial 's on . " <p> " Right , see ? " I clumsily gathered my paperwork up as if done , piling thoughtless stacks . At the edge of things , I could sense something was smoldering , a fear coming . " But I meant it like , I 'm going . I 'm not even here , still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> I licked where my lips tasted hot from my herpes sore . " Wait a sec . Hold it a second , " I winced . <p> Like my mother , Maria took hold of my shoulder and I thought I would fall . <p> " Yeah , sure , " she said . " Would it kill you for once to say yes ? ' Is that so tough ? Or is it-is it just you always , always , always have to mess with me ? " she said . <p> My voice sounded thin to me , and being almost a solid month single , I was unsure how to talk to her , or how to be . I just wanted to become tiny and to sleep again . I pretended to walk somewhere necessary , and , rounding the corner to marketing I spotted our boss and the payroll guy , head-to-head . They laughed liked conspirators , whispering things . Nervous sweat soaked me , beading up wet on my face and neck . I was sopped with it ! I wiped at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why pretend it would ? <p> I hid . I knew I 'd never make it until five . I did n't know what was going on . For weeks , I had been waking and lying in my bed , still exhausted , denying the hideous white daylight which ruthlessly sucked me back into the world , me putting off opening my eyes again and fully returning to the land of the calm . . . my problems , my ex , Rebecca , tossing plates at me , me tossing them back . Truly , I did n't know what all was wrong . . <p> I had been having nightmares in which my stepfather beat me with his fists while I stabbed at him with a knife . Dark people choking and embarrassing me . Dreams where I woke up crying , or muttering things , totally unable to remember what it was that I had just then , shivering , dreamed . <p> Now I hid with the ghosts of those seventies bands in the stockroom-I should add that this was back when I worked the phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were mergered and swallowed whole . Sweet Melanie , Carly and dull Helen Reddy . Hiphuggered Cher . I could almost reach out and touch her , there in the air . In my window a floor-to-roof view of the city . We could all be free so quickly , I reasoned , troubled by these forgotten singers , and I leaned , distractedly touching at myself in front of the other tiny office people numb in the building across from me . But below them , and down diagonally from me through my window , two snickering guys stood silently waving up while a third pointed for the unseen laughing others to hurry and take a look . And did n't this seem it had all happened somehow before ? Over and over and over again ? No , not this specific humiliating incident , in the stockroom , but something uncannily like it . The onlookers always of course were different , yet more or less acted exactly the same . <p> I caught sight of the big , green FUJI FILM blimp careening then , trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and absolute bomb , but hobbling , piggish almost , as if caught on a piece of string . The wind tugging it . Its pilots obviously drunk and almost fishtailing themselves into the towering , lit-up Tishman Building , adrift in these skyscrapered winds . Beyond the green blimp rose a choir of granite spires , the knife-tipped Helmsley , the cake-like Plaza . All of us-everyone watching-wished the thing would explode . What arrogance ! What use was there even in trying in such a world ? <p> I saw , outside and across from my building in a window a story or two down , another dress-suited , lonely worker . An older , unfortunate blonde woman in her own glass office who watched the blimp , or who had started watching it , and no longer actually was , as she thinly sighed . Then she touched her tears . I saw her ! She was baring her heartunaware and alone , with this unrehearsed act , standing angly there , nibbling the arms of her glasses . . . her suffering she just took for granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could read it all : she did n't still have a lover , that much was for sure . So what good was it ? What use then were all of her objects , that shitty vase ? <p> If only I could be there and touch her , I thought ! If only I could reach out and comfort her , whisper it , nuzzle those words in her hair . I know you . I know where you 're hurting , I said . <p> I thought if I could just come with her once . The doorknob clicked and I crouched by a file of old disco hits . One of my sort-of-friends , Donny , peeked the door open and slipped on in . " Beat me to it , man . Every day , someone 's done sneaked in here ahead of me . " A handsome and southem-voiced weightlifter , in a lousy band , Donny never seemed to much care . <p> " Whatever you 're doing , you 're caught , " he said . " What ? " I said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kidding . " " Pretty crappy , huh ? " " Kind of . " <p> " I 'm just feeling sort of like , well . " <p> Donny closed us in . " So forget all this noise . What 's outside ? Hey , whoa , " he said . <p> My eyes wrenched up blurring with tears . <p> " Whoa , baby . You are really not feeling so good . " <p> " Exactly , yeah . You 've hit it right on the nose . " My mood flopped around like a tired child 's , and when Donny walked over to touch me I flinched at this animal shine in his eyes , like a dog or something . I saw for a split second how he might like to bite me , to rip my throat , like everyone did on my morning train . Donny crushed my arm . " Leave this crap . Let 's go upstairs and let me buy you a beer . " <p> " Our commercial 's on . I 've got to count when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself having a criminal cast of mind , did not trust that the regional television commercials he paid for would ever truly play as the stations said , so we each took turns for him counting their airings , we underlings , Donny , Maria , and me . Donny flexed his neck muscles and walnut sounds popped in his body . He tugged my arm . " Huh , say , you jerkoff , let 's split . Let 's sneak upstairs to the bar for some beers . " <p> " What was that ? " <p> " What was when ? " <p> " No , you said .... Nothing , man . Never mind . Skip it . Well , first look if you see Maria . " " Maria . " <p> " She hates me . She does ! " I said . <p> He twirled the brown curls on his forehead . " No way , friend . Might turn me like into a lizard . " " A toad , you mean . " <p> " Toad , fucking rhino , whatever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Texas . For Chuck E Cheese 's . I wonder , like , how would you . . . What if you shot it ? " he said . Something was wrong with my thinking . Our office girls , the blonde woman across from my window-if I could just touch her , I thought , I 'd be saved . What an utter mess . It 's not that I missed my old girlfriend . I missed all of them . I did n't trust women , but I could n't bear being alone . <p> Once , I had tried to ask Maria to lunch , but my nerves failed me . Now I regret those unlived bits of life . And I ask myself-if only I 'd talked to her , what would have eventually happened ? Where would all of our rendezvous have led ? To what secrets , what unrelieved hours of pleasure ? <p> Donny and I headed for the elevator down at the service hall . We passed office doors , desked workers wistfully glimpsing us , cloistered nuns , old guys erotically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that glance . Yes , it gripped my heart , everyone hiding their lives . We caught the big swaying elevator car to the bar at The Top of the Sixes . Donny clutched his crotch . " Do n't let it get to you . I piss on that job from up here , " he said . What a cruel trick-that elevator ! Inches away from my loafers , it fell away , the sheer , dropping black hole below us , so empty , that freon-cool , deep-shafted whistling air . <p> I felt queasy . <p> " Hey , I hope you 're not broke , " Donny said . Then a hundred floors . Me , I suspected dark entities chewed through each cable 's core . Grimy trolls , beings which squeezed from my consciousness . Yet if our elevator fell through the singing air , it would take only seconds to crush to our death . <p> Where would my girlfriend be then ? I did n't know what was still eating me-my chest trembled . After our fight with the dishes , Rebecca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was bleeding , the linoleum petaled with thrown scrambled eggs . Making love to her , I thought we were maybe made-up . We could talk it out . But weirdly , when I spoke to her , all I could make was this screechy slur . <p> I was obsessing on women at work , and projected these nervous and sex-filled imagined scenes , even now , shakily scouting the bar . The chromy lounge . Another insanely high view of Manhattan . The place was dead . Donny knew our young actor-waitress . They kissed hello , and she headed us off to a booth by the windows . Our first drinks were free . Donny said , " That girl 's Victoria . What a pair of lungs . Go ask who the other girl is , her barmaid friend . " <p> " Are you kidding ! Not me , man . I 'm way too tense . " " Aw , come on . Cheer up , " he said . <p> I was helpless . There was nowhere to hide . I looked down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were just sitting here , anyhow . " " We are , " he said . " But we 're in the catbird seat .... I think they 've just finished their shift . " " No way , " I said . " No ! I 'm not going . " <p> " O.K. , O.K. All right already , then . If I 'm not back quick , watch my drink , " he said . Then he left , and I never saw Donny again . I mean ever again . He was swallowed up . <p> While I waited around , hiding , my drinking arm was shaking like a starving pup , spilling gin , and tipping my glass by the window . When I looked down over our gray city , toy buildings , the miniature-golf-sized horizon reeled up , tilting wrong like a carnival ride . I threw back that blued icy gin . <p> It was nearly five , yet I could n't cool down my mind . Back at my desk hung this Post-It note left by Maria . You 're dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , You are not here-4:10 ! Then I heard <p> Maria 's cough come across our thin cubicles . Around me , a few office phones bleated unanswered in a dozen dark offices and rang from the vacant desks . I was alone with her , trapped in our office . I knew I would see her before she arrived . In periphery , first her black dress , then the rest of her . <p> She dropped to the swivel chair next to my ratty desk , and naturally , I glanced up her legs as she slumped , as she crossed her legs , and tried not to look up her dress . <p> " Guess what , " she said . " Guess what I heard from Stu . " " Yeah , shoot , " I said . <p> " You 're up the river , I heard . To your neck in it . " " Boy , that is some kind of dress . " <p> She reached for her Post-It note , crumbling it up . She was flaming ! " A ten-year-old . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aleck ? " she said . I had n't fully caught what I 'd said . " What ? What ? " I said . " My dress , huh . " <p> I could n't look at her straight in the eye , and pretended I was staring at the doodled shapes scrawled on my desk blotter , panicking , my tongue feeling thick as clay . " What ? It 's nice , " I said , suddenly knowing some blush , or some gesture or muscular twitching might somehow reveal to her I was afraid , not of her-but of all of the signs of my fear itself . <p> " You asshole . Is that all is left in your head ? Christ , all you guys ! Is everything sexual ? " she said . <p> I looked at her shining black thicket of coiling hair . She leaned closer , until I felt where she breathed her cool breath on me , looming some . " What 's up with you , William ? You 're wigging out . You 're hitting on me-are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . <p> I did n't know what else to tell her . I could n't see what to say . Every second , yes , God , what connivance , what lies ! In between orders I Amexed , I had plotted the cloth-hidden arc of her breasts , and the rest of her . I imagined where her sex slanted up in her dress . I did that , the way that I do with all women . Every one of you . Only vaguely attached to my work . But now all the words muddled . I was caught . I could n't see what to say . My pulse rushing , roared in my head like the Xerox . I just grinned at her , nothing inside me but air ; that 's it , I thought . Me , an inflated man . <p> Maria leaned over me , whispering , her arm sliding warm on my shoulder , her words buzzing . " Look , why do n't we go out and talk somewhere . " She touched my hair . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to flirt with me , honey ? " she said . " I-got to run . I 'm kind of nauseous , " I said , unconnecting us . " I 'm holding you ? " <p> I gathered my briefcase and jacket . <p> " Wait , hold the elevator ! Let me go grab my coat , " she said after me . I told myself , not in a billion years , punching the door button , and every other elevator button that would close the door . I would n't have made it alone with her . Alone in the elevator 's box with her mind . <p> I felt as if I 'd been gnawed up inside of some giant mouth . Chewing sounds , everything wanting to eat . <p> What a nervous mess ! Out in the canyons of city air , I dodged all the office-trons staggering for home . Exposed , it seemed , as if Maria had intruded into one of my dreams . No way could I secretly lust for her now , having ditched her , and now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forty-second Street , I bought a paper to hide my face , and caught an express for the Village . If I could just get away by myself , I thought , I 'd be fine . <p> But dragging up from the stinking , dark steps of the subway , I saw this small crack buzzard scamming on Twelfth Street , perched in a doorway , thin as death . I sped up some , automatically regretting I had done it , and slowed my walk almost to calm , but the thin dude had already moved out of his doorway . He scooted up , saying things , when he was hardly close enough to be heard , " Sharp jacket , Slick . Say , let me ask you a question . Wait ! Wait a second . Excuse me , God damn you , a second , " keeping by me , looking up with these wild navigational glances . " Excuse me , wait ! Shit , ca n't I ask you a question ? You better'n me , Slicky ? " and such as that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , I guess . Then he just snatches my arm like a crab . <p> " Whoa ! What the hell ? Jesus ! " I said . What was going on ? How did they sense when you 'd weakened some ? I could n't ditch him , could n't fend him off ; he clutched at the sleeve of my jacket , and side by side , both of us broke into a jog . <p> Unbelieving , I pulled us out into the traffic , yanking free of him . " Slick , look at here . You ai n't together . . . , " he said . I was running . <p> Near my neighborhood , one bum was bashing an older bum , throttling him . " Give me my dollar , " the younger one yelled . The air had a color , like something was on fire somewhere . Things were starting to fog . Peripherally , the buildings were smeared with a nauseous blur . I had stood on this comer a zillion times , yet for a second I forgot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Give me half of one . Give me my dollar ! " the younger bum begged . I almost vomited . <p> Then things began jelling back , and I sensed my girlfriend , her essence , a few blocks away from my home . I 'm right here , I said , and placed myself right where I was . I hid , and watched my apartment from beneath a thin dogwood tree . I was home now , but I could n't go through the door , through that darkenend hall . They could cut me down , strip me and shovel my heart out ; I did n't care . I could n't talk anymore . My arguments with my girlfriend were waiting upstairs , not physically her with her actual body , but a memory-her . The aftershock of hours of fighting . Our anger , it pressed every inch of the walls . What tension ! Our poisons would haunt up the air in there after Rebecca and I were long dead . <p> What else was it ? I felt in my pockets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 'd deserted me . On the intercom , when I buzzed our drunk super to let me in , all I could make was that weepy slur . I was so tired , with no chance to sit and be quiet somewhere . I had my problems . I got barely warmed . I do n't know what else to tell . <p> Sure , a child was n't dying . There were people in this world far worse off than me , and you could sit there , I guess , and honestly argue how I just wanted to feel someone 's mothering pity . " Ah , cheer up , " people said . I was really dumb . I thought I wanted to die . But I never did . I 'm like anyone . I 'm still here . I lived . <p> 
##1003659 Lieutenant Manuel Hernandez Galvan tapped my shoulder and drew a bead on me with his head . " Red , " he said . " Is this fair ? " " No , " I said , pleased with myself . <p> Because she had asked me , I was dancing with his date , Carmelita Rubio , old as a three-finger baseball glove . And beautiful as such a glove is . This was the New Year 's Fiesta at Christ Is King Church . The Feast of the Epiphany in Las Almas , New Mexico . 1944 . Fifty years ago . These are facts . You must take my word . <p> Near us , my wife Cecilia danced with Father Velasco . People will say a priest should not dance , and should not dance good if he dances at all . Ignorant people , with no antidote for all the Virtue poisoning them , say that to dance is dangerous for a priest , and to dance good is to break the celibacy vow . Cecilia danced good with him , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their arms swept each other 's arms . They danced too good , I admit this . But I loved Francisco Velasco , loved Cecilia , and the two kinds of love I felt were blue and red flame and part of the same fire . <p> My right hand was opened , and pressed against Carmelita Rubio 's hunched back . She cradled my neck with one hand and rested her other bare arm upon my own . She did not look at me , did not speak . The coldness of her flesh excited me . <p> The fiddle made the good sound of a bad door hinge in the music . That was Liston Potter , the fiddler , who was Cecilia 's uncle . When Cecilia was a child , he made kites for her and her friends , Liz Why , Margaret Loving Middleton , Agnes Perea , Libby Tolentino , and the three Sisters Ubeda . <p> This was our tenth wedding anniversary . Cecilia and I married on January second , 1934 , when we were twenty-five years old . There was much I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I said to Father Velasco , " You are humming . " He was not humming to the music , he was only humming . He was humming , and hovering , and swaying with my wife in his arms . <p> He did not hear me . Cecilia heard , and repeated it to him over the screechy singing of the blind and musically disabled singer for the band , Los Zopilotes . <p> Father Velasco pivoted so that Cecilia 's back was to me , and he said , " I apologize , " which meant for everything . For everything , he wished to have my absolution . <p> " Look ! " said Carmelita . " Father Velasco . The man dances ! " " He sure does , " I said . <p> My mother waved . She and Maggie Gamboa served food at the tables around us in the Christ Is King parish hall . Sadness darkened my mother 's dark face . " Mexican-cinnamon " was how my father described her beautiful skin . My father had died in that same year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stone wall he was building for The Three Sisters Ubeda , Faye , Arlene , and Altadena . He had curled himself up and closed his arms around his knees . When Faye found him , he was like a stone waiting to be lifted into place , she said . I completed the wall for The Sisters *beda . Their payment paid for his funeral . I loved him , my father . I missed him . The part of his wall that I completed is the only part of the wall that now , fifty years later , needs repair . <p> Carmelita 's cool arm moved over mine . The soft inside of her arm . This was no accident . I noticed , yes , and would n't you ? Old , I said to myself , widow . Only an accident that we touched this way . An accident . Her fingers on my neck crept into the hair behind my ear . Two fingers trembled over the crescent of smoothness there . The back of her cold thumb brushed the lobe , which filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not hear it through that clanging ear . Did I move my feet ? My feet had stopped . Of themselves they had stopped . I gave myself more medicine against this . Decaying , I said . Petrified . " Dona Carmelita . What do you-mean ? " I asked . <p> Somehow her satin dancing slippers held me still . <p> " You , " I said , " you , you . You are standing on my feet . Are you standing on my feet ? " I could not look down . She offered her fragrant white hair to the tender purse of flesh under my chin . I was forty years younger than her . I was barely thirty-five years old . If she had spoken , could she have been more obscene in her bravery with my body ? <p> " Mr. Greet , " said Antonio Velasco . " I wish you a happy anniversary . " He was Father Velasco 's father . And leading him over the dance floor was Mrs. V Many years before , when Father Velasco and I were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , terrible and wonderful miracles had happened in this family . <p> " Thank you , " I said . <p> " Gracias , " Cecilia said , one hand on Father Velasco 's shoulder , one closed hand in the center of his back , closed and maybe clasping his white priest 's shirt . I had white shirts like that one . I had eight of them . Stolen . I am ashamed to tell about them . <p> Carmelita 's bright black chaleco , her vest , swung open , and on the inside I saw the pattern I had not noticed on the outside : small vermilion snakes chasing large green ones . Her nose , the icy tip , rubbed against the plum in my throat . Have you touched this hard fruit with your own fingers ? And can you ever know its ripeness as you can through another 's touch ? <p> " Again , " she whispered . <p> " Again ? " I asked . " What do you mean ? " <p> I could move my feet once more . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Again " into my throat , but she had not said it to me . Lieutenant Galvan answered her , " All the night would please me , Carmelita . " <p> I said , " Have mercy . " I wanted to say something more clever . I felt the need of cleverness to hide my lust . <p> He said , " Dona Carmelita is too hot for you , Red . " <p> No cleverness would come . None . Slowly , through the broken fences around my thoughts , I found words I once saw on a gravestone : " One must do battle to prepare for war . " I said this to the lieutenant : " One must do battle to prepare for war . " And I said , " She was helping me hold back the other women . " <p> He danced away with her , his boots tapping the floor between her black slippers . When Lieutenant Galvan captured her , this dove , this soothing , soaring shadow , delicate lace of frost , sleeping buried tulip , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hunched back , I was pronouncing her beauty inside me . How can I help pronouncing it now ? The benedictions of an old man who thirsts . Recita Holguin danced with me then . Too close . Her long hair streamed down her back . I wished to dance with my wife Cecilia but there was the distraction of Liston and the careening , blind , musically ungifted singer and Los Zopilotes , and my throat burned wonderfully , and Recita 's hair was black , coppery red , and silver , and since she was our friend , if she asked me to dance I had The Obligation , did I not ? <p> On the next morning at Dona Carmelita 's ranch Father Velasco and I met with Lieutenant Galvan , and the famous photographer who was Dona Carmelita 's guest . <p> Father Velasco had arranged the photographer 's visit . He was a priest , and not a bishop yet . The photographer , who had photographed Lieutenant Galvan in Mexico twenty years before , in 1924 ( a famous picture ) , wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lieutenant Galvan shooting a peso at fifty paces . <p> The photographer would not cross the border into Mexico this time . It was wartime . The border guards annoyed him , he said . He needed Lieutenant Galvin to cross instead . Father Velasco , who said he owed the photographer a favor , hosted the reunion between the two men . Famous men . He recruited me as their guide around Las Almas . My soul knows the reason I said yes . I said yes because I loved him , Father Velasco . He had been my closest friend for thirty years . I would commit any sin in his service . This was my reason . ( But I ask you : What favors does a priest owe to anyone except to God and other priests ? ) <p> So . We met Lieutenant Galvan at the ranch gate . It had an iron arch fifteen , sixteen feet high , and on the arch : " Aqui la puerta es corazon siempre abierta . " He said , " Go ahead . " <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is iron made into words ? A path led through Dona Carmelita 's small pecan orchard . In his tan long-sleeve shirt and khaki pants , Lieutenant Galvan , over eighty years old at that time , looked like he commanded the uneven ranks of her trees . <p> Dona Carmelita met us at her door , fitting her hand inside the lieutenant 's hand when she greeted him . She wore a tan blouse , a colorful jacket and skirt , a white wool stocking cap over her white hair , one snowfall upon another , one blessing blessed , and her wrinkled skin darkest bronze . Hunched the way she was hunched she was the noblest pinon , the kind that grows from broken boulders in our mountains . I said , " I like your words . On your gate . " <p> " Me too , " said Father Velasco . <p> She said nothing . Who knows if she heard us ? How is iron made into words ? It must be heated . It must be cooled . <p> She wanted to come along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chewed with his eyes , chewing at her and at her small patio she walked us to . He explained that she would break their concentration if she came . " Intense concentration in marksmanship , my dear . And greater in the art of photography . You can not conceive of the difficulties , " he said . <p> She said , " You will take Red ? " <p> The photographer had no wish to be polite . " Red is a man , " he said . " Yes , " I said . <p> Father Velasco and Lieutenant Galvan said nothing . Nothing , and yet they both looked at her closely , which caused me to look . On her face and neck , she had white down , white against her darkest bronze skin . White at the corners of her lips . <p> I had been close enough once before to see this down on her . In Columbus , New Mexico , I had been at the funeral of Carmelita 's husband , Jimmy Rubio , who had been a bad man-and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on her throat when she reached into the open coffin . Everyone saw . She reached in to pull Jimmy Rubio 's trouser pockets , all four , inside out . " Where is it ? " she asked Jimmy , who was not likely to answer . " Where is it ? " <p> Strange grief . God alone understands . And what about the " it " she looked for ? Did she think Jimmy had asked someone to put it in the pockets of his burial clothes ? Was it something he had taken from her ? <p> We left her behind . We walked into the desert north of her home . Murmuring turtle doves fell silent and flung themselves from the creosote and mesquite . Their wings made blessings in the air , which was full of good burning desert incenses . We-the photographer and Lieutenant Galvan , Father Velasco , and I-we talked about the it . I had told them Jimmy Rubio 's funeral story because we had four things that reminded me . Father Velasco had God 's grace , which creates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The photographer had the camera , which seizes time . And Lieutenant Galvan , he had the gun , which erases time . How could I not remember ? One of his hands held the carved ivory grip of the Colt .45 , and one hand anchored the other hand . True aim . Seven and one half inches of polished barrel , silverplated . <p> Lieutenant Galvan walked in short steps . He wore big , sharp Mexican spurs that made a warning jingle which horses and horsemen could understand . But I think his legs were not strong . The night before , his legs had run far on the dance floor . The photographer and Father Velasco and I slowed down to be respectful . <p> " Your boots , " I said to the lieutenant , " are not good . " <p> " You see right , " he said . " They shame me . " <p> " Unfortunate , " said Father Velasco . <p> The photographer said , " They are wonderful . " I knew that already he had made a mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Mexican dust and the blood of Villistas and Zapatistas . Imagining a little further , he might picture them being taken from a dead man . We walked toward a small jacal and a cluster of tamarisk , and , above them , a dinosaur fig tree that bowed over them like a hand in its hundredth year of slowly closing . An old tree is more patient than anything . We were quiet , but inside us we were unrestful . I remembered Cecilia 's hand , her right hand clutching the white cloth of Father <p> Velasco 's shirt . I remembered Recita Holguin leading me over the dance floor . And Elizabeth Velasco leading Antonio Velasco . And Liz and Margaret and Libby taking turns dancing with each other , taking turns leading . <p> I told my theory about the it that Carmelita Rubio had looked for in Jimmy 's pocket . " The it was stolen by Jimmy Rubio , " I said . " Carmelita 's mother 's golden pin , something worth fortunes . A key to a lockbox ! " " Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " I feel it would have been something sentimentally invaluable . Perhaps a belt or comb . " He asked Lieutenant Galvan , " What do you think ? " <p> Lieutenant Galvan said , " She was a soldadera . " <p> Soldadera . The photographer was probably already engraving the word upon his dull brain . <p> " A soldadera ? " asked Father Velasco . He wore the same white shirt he had worn at the fiesta . I wore a white shirt too , but fresh . " She was a soladera , " said the lieutenant . " A soldier in the revolution . " <p> " She told you this ? " I asked . " No , " he said . " I know . " <p> " Splendid ! " said the photographer , who I could not like , I tell you . The lieutenant said , " I met her once back then . I had known her- " Whatever he wanted to tell , he withheld . Instead , he said , " She was famous . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I asked . " As a saint is , " he said . <p> When he said this , I believed . With no cause , I suddenly did not doubt at all this fact about Se*ora Rubio . ( I am Catholic . I disbelieve . I believe . I disbelieve . Amen . ) <p> Father Velasco believed too , but that was his nature , and not mine . He said , " Soldadera ! Of course ! " <p> I wanted Lieutenant Galvan to tell us more , but he stepped under the shadows of the fig tree . He placed his gun on the roof of the jacal , which was no more than a falling-down doghouse of juniper branches . " I met her on a train , " Lieutenant Galvin said . " She commanded this train . She had lieutenants . Many . And armed troops of women . " He asked me , " You have the peso ? " <p> I had a pocketful of them that I punched so they jangled like Lieutenant Galvan 's spurs . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all on my face or in my head . I felt his eyes chewing me , and I looked at my shoes . They were nothing special . I looked at Father Velasco 's shoes . Newly resoled-the loot of the cobbler Amezquita who gave the priests in our town the shoes unclaimed by his customers . <p> " It would be best , " the photographer said , " if we would rehearse . " He explained to me that they had rehearsed , after all , even in 1924 when he took the first famous picture of Lieutenant Galvan , sixty years old then . He told me they had no third or fourth persons with them in Mexico . But it was " splendid " to have us along , and since we were along , we were to walk fifty paces away . The photographer would stay near Lieutenant Galvan . <p> The lieutenant pointed . " Pace fifty south , " he said . " How high you can throw-throw that high . " <p> Father Velasco walked the fifty paces with me . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The photographer planted his wooden tripod low on the ground and aimed the camera up at the lieutenant to make him look big as a war monument . This was how he took the picture in 1924 also . I know this method : with only the essence of a truth , you make perfume . When I tossed the first peso it went high and away . Lieutenant Galvan swung his arm and fist up . Calm . Smooth . In one motion of his index finger he squeezed an imaginary trigger . And missed . By a mile , he missed . <p> I knew I could not find that peso . I did n't look . The next peso I threw up straighter but not high . Lieutenant Galvan pretending , shooting again with his empty hand , missed it . How far ? Far . If the gun had been in his hand , the picture would be a portrait of Pancho Villa 's lieutenant , Manuel Hernandez Galvan , shooting Red Greet in the face at fifty paces . <p> I caught the peso @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught it . In a single action , Lieutenant Galvan pretended to shoot at the shining target in my fingers . Missed by a mile . We both laughed . He pretended to shoot Father Velasco , who thumped his chest and said , " Got me . " The photographer crouched down , aimed his camera up to make Lieutenant Galvan big as he might look in history books . The lieutenant picked up the gun now , turned it in his right hand , his eyes traveling along the barrel as along a train track . He held the Colt out for the camera to see , but he was not thinking about the gun . He said , " You know this it . This is how I believe : It was a picture of Dona Carmelita . Jimmy Rubio wanted a picture of his wife to keep with him in Hell . " <p> " My God ! " said the face behind the camera . The beauty of a photograph is its silence . A photographer should know this . But the photographer said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the silver barrel across his thick silver mustache . He was smelling the steel . " Jimmy had a photograph of her when she was young , " he said . " Dona Carmelita was naked in this photograph . Naked and pregnant . " " My God ! " said the termite voice of the camera . " Jesus Mary Joseph , " said Father Velasco because God 's name had now been taken in vain twice . <p> Lieutenant Galvan pointed the gun at the termite photographer and motioned a certain way with his shoulders to ask me if he should . " Go ahead , " I said . I meant , Put us out of our misery . Shoot him . His tiny head behind the camera , the photographer grunted the word , " Naked . " <p> " She was maybe not all naked , " said Lieutenant Galvan . " She was showing off her gun and her ammunition belts . Naked except for her gun and ammunition belts . This was the photograph Jimmy stole from her to take with him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was naked and armed , where Jimmy was going everyone would want to see . They would get to look , and she did not want this . The history of her body . The history of her soul . Would you want Jimmy Rubio to have this ? The photographer 's head , a puppet head , a finger inside it where the brain should be , popped out from behind the camera . " Everything , all the light , and this breeze , is marvelous , " said the photographer . " We must go on . " He motioned to us where we should stand . First , he pretended to take a picture of Lieutenant Galvan shooting the gun at nothing . This was the rehearsal . The photographer pretended he was shooting pictures . The lieutenant was shooting real bullets , reloading . " Shoot , " he said to Lieutenant Galvan . " Again . Again . " The photographer made him step out of the shadows and bring the Colt near his face . He asked him to shoot the gun in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Next , he asked the lieutenant to fan the hammer as if killing six . <p> Father Velasco stood right next to me through this , all of this . Recita Holguin had danced at least as close to me as Father Velasco had with Cecilia . Carmelita Rubio and I had danced with her cool arms moving over my arms . <p> The lieutenant 's left profile was better than his right because his left eye squinted half-closed when he aimed . He shot many bullets . He obliged the photographer . Reloaded . <p> Afterwards , the photographer said , " There is so much smoke , is n't there . " Disappointed . The cordite smelled no different from the air of the desert , no different really . <p> When the rehearsing was over , it was time to take the real photographs . <p> I have a donkey 's heart . I was afraid . Father Velasco calmed me . " Fountain of Heaven . Mother of God . Ark of Peace , " he said . A blessing . <p> Lieutenant Galvan could see I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can throw . " <p> The photographer said , " Say ' NOW ' before you toss it up there . " Father Velasco stood closer . The coin grew cold in my fingers . Colder and colder . Smaller and smaller . " NOW ! " I said . <p> The picture happened fast . <p> The photographer took one shot at the instant the lieutenant took one shot . <p> Missed by a mile . <p> We all walked to where we thought the peso fell . We walked slow , I think , to not have to look at one another . We knew the peso was unwounded , whole . <p> " Over here , " said Lieutenant Galvan . He dropped his own peso , shiny , fresh from his shirt pocket , onto a patch of sand white as paper . He stood with the toes of his boots almost on the peso 's edges . Unblinking , he aimed and shot a hole through it . <p> What were we supposed to say ? The priest did not know . The famous photographer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only I , unfamous Red Greet , had ever found himself in such a lion 's den of need . I said , " Your boots ! You could have ruined them ! " Father Velasco picked up the coin . He handed it to me . I looked through the hole at Father Velasco , at the photographer , at Manuel Hemandez Galvan . I looked so close through the coin my eye felt the heat of the metal . With my mind I took the picture of the truth , nothing like the famous picture . I said , " Perfect ! " <p> " Good shooting ! " said the photographer . " Amazing , " said Father Velasco . " It was , " said Lieutenant Galvan . Not a lie . On the walk back , Lieutenant Galvan said , " She broke my concentration . " <p> We could not disagree . We had spoken of Dona Carmelita when we should not have . <p> To shoot , Lieutenant Galvan had taken off his sombrero . He put it on again , not using the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck . He held the gun in front of him , below his waist . With one hand Lieutenant Galvan held the carved ivory grip of the gun , and with one hand he held the other hand . Just as before . Such weakness , so complete , I have seen only in men . We passed the ancient fig tree and her odd children , the tamarisks . <p> " She was a killer , " the lieutenant said . " A killer . " He walked in short steps . We could not walk as slow . We heard him behind us say , " The solladera song . All about her . " <p> Even I , Red the donkey , knew the anthem of the heroic soldaderas was " Adelita . " I would not correct him , a witness to the revolution . But the books say the song was " Adelita , " not Carmelita . <p> " She was a killer . " Lieutenant Galvan said this again , " She was a killer . " He could not keep up with us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more that he might say . " A sinner , " said Father Velasco . Maybe he meant Carmelita Rubio . Maybe Lieutenant Galvan . On her patio , she had prepared tea for us . Poured it into china cups . The saucers were handpainted with tiny blue crocuses and rose leaves and delicate thorns . <p> " I have made it weak , " she said , " but I have sugar . And fresh lemon . " She served us warm , moist bizcochitos . Dark . Coated in powdered sugar . She had made them that afternoon . <p> It would have been improper for her to ask us anything . She knew this and she waited . <p> The lieutenant took out the peso to show her . He and the photographer told the story . Slowly , they told the story , feeling their way along the path of it . In the newspapers and magazines their way was how the story was told . In the photographer 's books , their words were like carved ivory . Father Velasco said nothing . I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's end , she rested her hands on Lieutenant Galvan 's shoulders . She caressed his neck , looked down at the gun on the violet tablecloth covering the patio table . The way they told what they told is as you see it in the famous picture , more famous now than the first picture . Invincible old man in bright sunlight . No smoke . <p> Eyes fixed on a miracle . <p> The photographer said , in the newspapers and the magazines , he said he tossed the coin himself . He tossed the coin , he pressed the trigger of his camera , and he shot his one picture-a shot as true as the one shot of Manuel Hemandez Galvan , Pancho Villa 's lieutenant . <p> Red Greet was not there , you see ? And Father Francisco Velasco . Not there . Erased . <p> And Se*ora Carmelita Rubio ? <p> Never mentioned . No one mentions her . The gun , a gift from the lieutenant , she took into the grave with her , so people say . I was there the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I touched the white angel down on her nose and chin and at the comers of her cold lips . Yes , I touched it . Death gives permission . She had given the peso to her son who gave it to his son who will have sons who will want it because it is the peso , the one . It . <p> " Red ! " said my confessor . Bishop Francisco Velasco knew all along it was me across from him in the confessional . Yes . Now , so many years later , he was a bishop . And yet he heard confessions once a month . He could not abstain from hearing stories . He liked especially the stories that he was in . <p> " Red ! " he said , amazed and thrilled . " History is a great sin ! But it is not your sin ! " " Are you sure ? " I asked . " I was there , " he said . " I was there ! " <p> In that little room with all the carpeting and curtains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Recita Holguin or Mr. Holy-InThe-Front-Pew might have been waiting in the line for confession . He put his head close to the caning between us . " I can not absolve this . " " So ? " <p> " So . I can not absolve a sin that is not your sin . " " Nothing ? " <p> He sounded like he was picking his teeth . He was picking his teeth or taking his chewing gum out . Where to put it ? He said , " God 's ways ! " <p> He began his own confession , confessing to himself . " Bless me , Father , for I have sinned , " he said . " I have become Red Greet 's confessor . I am Red Greet 's friend . I never believed Red Greet would come to confession sinless . Hell would freeze first ! And for these things I ask forgiveness . <p> I should not tell this , but he was laughing . He absolved himself , more absolution than the usual . He gave himself many penances , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He asked me , " You like potatoes ? " At first , I thought he was still talking to himself , since he had cooked potatoes for me many times . " I slice them thick , " he said , " put lard in an iron pan , chop in chiles , onion , big wedges of yellow onion , salt , cilantro . You like potatoes like this ? " Before I could answer , he said , " I know you do . " <p> Onions and chiles and potatoes ! Jonah , who was spat from the darkness , did not feel as blessed as I did . " So ? " The bishop said . <p> I received no absolution . I was given no penance . I made the sign of the cross . I resolved to sin no more because that is how confession ends , no matter what . I opened the door to the confessional . <p> " Anybody out there ? " the bishop asked from his dark booth . <p> " No one , " I said . @ 
##1003660 When Elspeth saw the dark windows of her father 's house , she did not bother to knock at the door but retraced her steps down the short street of elderly people and made her way to Perth Station . In spite of the cold she knew she would find him with the other train-spotters , pursuing his mysterious hobby . Within a few minutes , she entered the Victorian gloom of the station . On the main platform a dozen travelers , men in anoraks , women with shopping bags , waited dispiritedly for the next train to Glasgow but Elspeth hurried by . For the spotters , departure and arrival , indeed the whole notion of travel , were irrelevant . Their territory was a concrete peninsula , stretching out amidst the converging rails to that neglected part of the station where , in summer , wild lupine sprang up between the sleepers . Elspeth passed the Gents , the parcel office , and there was her father a hundred feet ahead , studying his trainspotters ' guide . <p> Even from a distance he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tramp . He wore a good suit and a raincoat of immense shabbiness . His white hair , with no one to chivvy him into haircuts , straggled to his shoulders . Although he had grown up in Lancashire , his high coloring and bloodshot blue eyes often made people think he was Scottish . <p> While he read , the Gordon twins circled him , practicing something that involved staccato movements and high kicks ; it could have been kung fu , it could have been dancing . The few other train-spotting boys Elspeth had met had been painfully earnest , with duffle coats and glasses , whereas the twins had leather jackets and tattoos . Raymond , the older by eight minutes , had a nose ring . <p> " Dad , " she said . " Walter . " <p> The twins gyrated away , leaving her father to greet her . " Elspeth , I 'd forgotten you were coming . We 're waiting for the Highland Chieftain . Raymond thinks it might be a Class 26 with a Sulzer engine . How are you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the single bench provided by British Rail . After a moment her father joined her . " I 'd offer you some tea , " he said , " but I 'm afraid I drank it all . " <p> He shook his tartan thermos to prove his claim and stared off down the tracks . Elspeth knew he was not pleased to see her-the two of them were in the middle of a battle-and she , in turn , stared at the ground . A fleck of white landed on the toe of her worn black boot , then another . She began to count the snowflakes , tiny and evanescent . At fifty-three her father gave in . " Guess what Justin was telling me ? " he said . " They 're going to have a policeman on duty at the high school . It makes me glad my teaching days are done . " <p> Justin was the younger of the Gordon twins , the one without a nose ring . Elspeth glanced over to where he and Raymond thrashed the air . If they were typical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense . Suddenly Raymond stopped waving his arms . " Here it comes , " he cried . <p> She stayed on the bench while Walter joined the twins at the edge of the platform . The three of them gazed towards the apparently empty south . Just as she began to think Raymond had been mistaken , a low vibration rewarded their attention and grew rapidly in volume and complexity . Soon the air was filled with the baffling odor of electricity . The Highland Chieftain appeared in a blur of noise . Her father stood at attention . The Gordon twins waved and gave V-signs . Then each of them made an entry in his notebook . Why did the twins keep two notebooks , Elspeth wondered . Would n't all their entries be the same ? <p> Her father picked up his knapsack . " You 're not staying for the foureleven ? " asked Raymond . <p> " I ca n't . " He nodded at Elspeth . " Goodbye , you two . " <p> " Goodbye , Walter , " they echoed . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way down the platform , past the still waiting travelers , he flung remarks over his shoulder . His favorite guard was doing a course in Inverness . His neighbor , Mrs. Bouldrey , was worried that her corgi was overweight . Elspeth had always considered her father a quiet man , but since the death of her mother , Flora , last February , he had relinquished silence with a vengeance . Now he preferred the hum of conversation , the grind and rattle of trains , the furious beat of the twins ' boom-box . At the dark house she waited for him to open the door ; he had given her a key after his crisis but she never used it . <p> This moment of crossing the threshold was the hardest part of each visit . Everything spoke to her of absence . The house was filled with a deep cold , as if one person were not enough to warm it , and on the wall to the left of the front door , the patterned wallpaper , half-stripped by Flora the day of her heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow anyone to touch her handiwork . Elspeth shivered as she surrendered her coat , but he did not seem to notice . While he made tea , she struggled to revive the living room fire , adding more coal and puffing the bellows , tasks she had often performed as a child . Then they had lived in a drafty farmhouse near Crieff and had visited Perth only on special occasions . Elspeth had never expected to end up here , nor to have her parents as neighbors , but after university her only good job offer had come from Perth Conservation Agency . Three years ago the agency folded and she had , as a temporary measure , taken her present position : office manager for a small firm selling pensions and life insurance . A month later , her mother had phoned to say she and Walter were retiring ; they had bought a house in Perth . <p> " What about the dogs ? " Elspeth said incredulously . Her parents had not even mentioned they were house-hunting . <p> " I 'm handing them over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new stock . Do n't worry , Elspeth . We wo n't be a bother . You 'll be free to lead your own life . " <p> Flora was a tall , handsome woman , who bred Labradors , smoked too much and , from Elspeth 's point of view , displayed an unsettling mix of myopia and insight . At the time of this conversation she and Barry had had just one drink together , yet her mother 's stress on the word " free " suggested she knew already the lie of the land . <p> Her father returned with the tea tray . He praised the small flames she had coaxed into being and poured the tea . They sat down : Walter in his armchair , Elspeth , hesitantly , in Flora 's . As he raised his cup , she saw his lips pucker ; he still missed sugar . " So , " he said , " how 's business ? Did you get a new assistant yet ? " <p> " Barry hired someone . Her name 's Deena and her typing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " Yes , she was a receptionist at the George and the manager claimed she was terrific . I suppose she mainly dealt with the guests . " Elspeth sipped her tea and wondered why she was being disingenuous . During the last week , she had watched Deena charm a succession of curmudgeonly clients in a way that made perfect sense of her glowing references . <p> " Still , " said her father , " you 'd think they would mention her skills . Or rather , the lack of them . " <p> As befitted a former math teacher , he was pedantically accurate . The moon was a day away from full , the train came at eleven fifty-nine , not noon . This quality which had amused Flora and driven his former pupils to rage had recently stood him in good stead . Six months ago , on a rather warm May afternoon , the Gordon twins , alarmed that he had n't shown up at the station for the five forty-five , had come round to find him in a coma . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pry open the living room window and climb in-she suspected burglary-but for whatever reason they had saved his life , behaving , when they discovered him breathing stertorously in bed , like the Boy Scouts they had briefly been and calling the ambulance with commendable speed . <p> Her father , at the age of seventy-three , had developed diabetes . His illness brought Christine , Elspeth 's older sister , from Aberdeen and Aunt Agnes , her mother 's younger sister , from Pitlochry . The three of them sat by his hospital bed talking in lowered voices about moving him into one of Agnes 's several spare rooms . She had a large house called Mafeking . <p> Suddenly his blue eyes snapped open . " What 's this you 're nattering about ? " He wasted no time in disabusing them . He would live alone until he was dead in his bed . <p> " But you 've done that , " Agnes pointed out . " If the boys had n't found you , you 'd be pushing up the daisies . " <p> " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And in fact diabetes had given his life a sense of purpose . The meals which formerly he forgot , or ate absentmindedly , now claimed his attention . He often phoned to tell Elspeth about specials at the supermarket . <p> The situation , simmering since his coma , had recently taken on new urgency when Agnes 's bursitis flared up and she had been offered a place in sheltered housing . She was loathe to accept but if Walter would not live with her , then it seemed the only sensible thing to do . She had argued her case , to no avail . Now Elspeth was here to add her pleas . She poured more tea and reported that she had spoken to Agnes the night before . " She has to let the sheltered housing people know by the end of the week . " <p> " I do n't know why she 's waffling . " <p> " She 's not waffling , she 's waiting for you to make up your mind . " " Elspeth , I 'll put up with this kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's no question of my moving in with Agnes . She would drive me batty in a week . " <p> " But what if something happens to you ? " At her father 's bedside , jolly Doctor Rintoull had laid out the grim spectrum of deterioration . " Something will happen , " he said . " Amputation , blindness , the whole shebang . Meanwhile I plan to live exactly as I please for as long as I can . When they cut off my legs , then we 'll see what 's next . " <p> He leaned forward with a gleam in his eye . " If you 're so worried , why do n't you move in here ? I have a nice spare room , the house is quite central , you can come and go as you please . Entertain whom you like . " <p> He saw her face and started to laugh . " Now you know how I feel . Do you think those feelings disappear as you get older ? " <p> It 's different , she wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , I could more easily walk on water than go back to living with you . " What about Agnes ? " she demanded . " She 's lived at Mafeking most of her life . " <p> " Frankly I think sheltered housing will suit her . She likes company . Of course moving will be a wrench but better now when it 's a choice , than later when she has to . " <p> Elspeth was about to protest-what was sauce for the goose was sauce for the gander-but Walter held up his hand . " I 'm not entirely stupid , " he went on . " I do understand that I need to be careful . I 've decided to take precautions . " <p> She was imagining an alarm system by the bed when he announced he had invited the Gordon twins to move in . <p> " The twins ? " Elspeth exclaimed . " You ca n't do that . " <p> " Why not ? You do n't want the room . " He crossed his legs , dangling one slippered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already made the arrangements with the boys , their harried mother , the school . Everyone approved . " Except you , " he added . <p> " Dad , they 're punks , they 're completely untrustworthy . " <p> Her father frowned . " I think you 're being a snob , " he said . " They saved my life , which from my point of view is significant , and they like the idea of living here . It 's all quite businesslike . We 've drawn up a contract . " <p> " And Agnes ? " <p> " Agnes , " he snorted , and rose to refill his cup . The snort was a sure sign that Walter was in a Bolshy mood . Elspeth gave up any thought of further argument . She finished her tea , put more coal on the fire and hurried away , leaving him to his Saturday night game of canasta with Mrs. Bouldrey and her corgi . When she phoned Agnes to break the news that he was adamant about not moving to Mafeking , Agnes simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " As for her sister , Elspeth decided to write . Christine was a research chemist at Aberdeen University and sometimes her reasonable tones were more than Elspeth could bear . To neither of them did she mention the Gordon twins ; she held onto the faint hope that her father was joking . <p> Certainly that was Barry 's reaction when she confided in him on Monday . They were in his office , ostensibly figuring out the schedule for the coming week . " But why would he joke ? " she asked . <p> " He wants to think he has choices ? " Barry suggested . " He wants to wind you up ? Really , Elspeth , he ca n't be serious . Even the best-behaved teenage boys are hard to live with and these two sound like a nightmare . At any rate , it 's not your problem . " <p> He smiled , offering a glimpse of his teeth , the lower jaw appealingly crowded , and asked if she had the file on Fisher 's Hotel . The personnel manager was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her office and turned on the computer . Not her problem was Barry 's response to most of her fears about her father . Although he was ten years her senior , his own parents were hale and hearty , not yet hostages to fortune , and he seemed unable to grasp the complex nature of Elspeth 's relations with Walter . Even as a joke , the notion of the Gordon twins sleeping in the guest room her mother had decorated was offensive . <p> As Elspeth scanned the screen , a familiar thought came to her : none of this would be happening if Flora were still alive . Although not a particularly orderly person she had , just by her presence , created order . Now her absence was revealing a side of Walter that Elspeth would much prefer remain hidden . <p> " Elspeth ? " Barry put his head round the office door . " Am I free tomorrow morning ? " <p> Then he caught sight of her watery eyes and came into the room . " I 'm sorry , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patted her shoulder and fleetingly , through her blouse and cardigan , she felt his comforting warmth . " Do n't be upset . Can we meet after work ? " <p> They made a plan and he left , taking the Fisher file with him . Elspeth went to organize Deena . She found her sitting on the floor playing peeka-boo with a solemn , round-headed baby ; the parents had stopped in to ask about life insurance and were studying a brochure . <p> Elspeth had last seen her mother a fortnight before she died . Flora had rung the office to ask if she was interested in the new Clint Eastwood film . Although Elspeth was unexpectedly free-Barry had just announced he could n't come to supper that evening-she made some lame excuse about work . <p> She got through the remainder of the afternoon , typing furiously , but as she carried the groceries she had bought at lunchtime up the stairs to her flat , despair overcame her . Cooking and eating sole veronique alone was out of the question . She opened the door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fled . <p> Flora was in the foyer of the Odeon , examining the concessions stand . At the sight of Elspeth she straightened with a smile . " You 're in the nick of time . I was about to succumb to the maltesers . " <p> Her cheerful acceptance of first Elspeth 's refusal , then her arrival , was maddeningly characteristic . During the film she leaned forward , gasping at tense moments . Around them impervious teenagers fondled each other and ate sweets . " Oh , no , " Flora exclaimed when Eastwood dropped his gun . <p> Nearby someone giggled . Shut up , Elspeth wanted to tell her , it 's only a film . She stared at the couple in front whose heads had not separated for an instant . <p> Afterwards they were on their way for a drink at the Mill bar when they passed one of the dingy pubs Elspeth sometimes frequented with Barry . " Let 's go here , " said her mother and , before Elspeth could demur , was through the door . In no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought drinks and found a table . As she raised her half pint , she looked around happily . " I like these seedy places . They remind me of dog shows , and I do n't feel so guilty about smoking . " <p> " I thought you were trying to quit , " Elspeth said . <p> " I am , but you know how hard it is to give up bad habits . I 'm down to ten a day . Almost . So how are you ? " <p> Flora 's face was bright with interest and for a brief moment Elspeth imagined herself saying , I was going to have dinner with Barry tonight but his wife changed her plans . He 's getting a divorce as soon as his youngest child starts school . Then she pulled herself together . <p> " Overworked and underpaid . We 're setting up a pension scheme for a weavers ' cooperative in Dundee . " She described the co-op which had been started by two sisters and was now a dozen strong . This was her favorite part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , make provision for the future , but her mother was blind to such pleasures . <p> " Maybe you should plan a holiday , " she said when Elspeth finished . " You did n't get away last year , did you ? " <p> " Not really . I did that training course in Edinburgh but it was n't exactly a holiday . " It had , in fact , been something better . Barry had been there and for ten days they had behaved like a normal couple : going to restaurants and films and sleeping in the same bed . Now she asked what her mother would suggest as a destination . <p> " Malta ? Crete ? " Flora gestured as if the smoky room were ringed with exotic islands . <p> " So why do n't you go away ? Was n't that the point of retiring ? " For as long as Elspeth could recall , her mother 's Labradors had made holidays well-nigh impossible . <p> " We are , did n't I tell you ? We 're getting fourteen-day rail passes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I plan to re-read Anna Karenina and forage for sandwiches while your father does his spotting . " <p> " That sounds the exact opposite of an island . " <p> " Yes , but it 'll make Walter happy . All those years of living in a place with no station . I 'd never realized how deprived he felt . " <p> " Top of the morning to you , ladies . " <p> A red-faced man swayed over their table . Elspeth stared into her beer , willing him to move on . <p> " And to you . " Flora raised her glass and he shuffled off towards the Gents . " Maybe he thought we were Irish . " She gestured to her own green pullover , Elspeth 's green scarf . " That 's a good color for you . By the way , did I tell you Tam died ? He caught a cold and never recovered . We went to the funeral last week . It was packed . " <p> Tam was a grubby old man , a frequenter of dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; she claimed he knew instinctively what ailed a dog and could effect a cure simply by laying on his hands . The news of his death was a surprise only because Elspeth had presumed him long dead . " I 'm sorry , " she said . <p> Flora shook her head . " I used to think of writing a book about himhe knew so much about dogs , and now it 's all gone . When Daisy was ill he had her better in no time . " <p> As her mother lit another cigarette , Elspeth felt again the lure of confession . Later such feelings would seem like a premonition , but at the time she pushed them aside . How was the redecorating going , she asked . Splendidly , Flora said ; she was planning to do the front hall next . <p> On their way back to the car park they passed Perth Theatre . Flora gestured at the photographs of The Cherry Orchard . " We 're going on Tuesday , " she said . " Would you like to come ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late . " <p> " Oh , well , if you change your mind , you 're welcome . " They continued walking past the various sculptures of the pedestrian precinct . " I used to think you would do something in theater . " <p> " Act ? " In her surprise Elspeth stopped walking . <p> " No , I do n't know . Design ? Direct ? Remember that year you were seeing so much of those two boys , David and Elsie ? The three of you were mad about theater . " <p> By now Flora was twenty , thirty feet ahead . Elspeth had to raise her voice . " I 'm learning a lot working for Barry , " she called . " Computer stuff , finance . When another conservation job comes along , I 'll be much better qualified . " <p> Flora came to a halt beneath a streetlight . " Yes , Perth is such a center for conservation . Elspeth , you 're only twenty-eight . You should n't be worrying about pensions and security . Walter and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christine , you know that . " <p> " Mother , I do n't need help . I have a good job . We ca n't all be chemists and dog breeders . " <p> " That 's not what I mean . Oh , forget it . Come and see The Cherry Orchard if you can . " <p> Elspeth kissed Flora 's cheek and fumed all the way home . What right had her mother to judge her life ? She understood nothing , nothing . The world was already over-run with dogs . Why make more ? And look at Walter loitering incessantly on Platform Four . There was a useful activity . <p> Elspeth had thought her father oblivious to her disapproval about the twins but on Wednesday he phoned to offer the olive branch of supper . He had a new chicken dish he was eager to try . On her way over she stopped at Marks and Spencer to look for a Christmas present for Agnes . She had thought the shop might be less busy than on a Saturday but it was seething . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Elspeth was examining a nightdress , blue and perhaps a little too daring for Agnes 's taste , when in the midst of the bustle a man standing still as a bird-watcher caught her eye . She moved to the next row of nightdresses . <p> Now she noticed his brown uniform shirt , with a square badge : a security guard . As she watched he seized a tweed jacket from the rack and slipped it on . Then she saw his prey . A middle-aged man was fumbling through the jackets at the other end of the rack . He wore only a pullover and it seemed clear his strategy would be the same as the guard 's , to don a garment and pretend ownership . <p> " Excuse me , sir , do you know how much this tie costs ? " said a loud voice . <p> Elspeth turned to see the Gordon twins in their leather jackets . Raymond was dangling a green tie with yellow spots before the disguised guard . The shoplifter started to run and the guard , shrugging off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shouting , " Security , security ! " <p> Raymond and Justin fell in behind and all four disappeared . When Elspeth left the shop ten minutes later with some salad and a loaf of bread , none of them had returned . <p> As she walked to the car and drove to her father 's , she wondered whether the twins , like her , had seen the shoplifter , or had merely been taking the mickey out of the guard , pretending interest in that frightful tie ? Whichever , their timing was spookily apt . They had intervened between cat and hapless mouse without acknowledging either . She thought of telling Walter and then , as she passed the station , thought better not . Any mention of the twins might encourage his absurd behavior . <p> This time the lights were on but her knock went unanswered . Finding the door open , she stepped into the chilly hall . " Hello , " she called . <p> " Anyone home ? " <p> " In the kitchen . " <p> Her father , wearing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooker reading one of his train books and stirring a saucepan . He kissed her and explained he was worried he would lose track of time in the living room . " I 'm reading about the Queen 4-6-0 . These huge gorgeous trains built by the Irish Great Southern Railway . They could pull a load of four hundred and fifty tons at eighty miles an hour . Only three of them were ever built , each named for an Irish Queen-Maeve , Macha and Tailte-then the war broke out , " he waved the spoon , " and no more Queens . " <p> He instructed Elspeth to open two bottles of light beer and soon they were seated at the table in the living room . She praised the chicken but Walter was doubtful . " I could n't find any tarragon . You can tell something 's missing . How was your day ? " <p> " All right . People do n't tend to think about pensions at this time of year , so we get to catch up . " <p> " But you never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean I 'm a good advertisement for that-one day happily watching trains , the next in hospital with people trying to take my legs away . " <p> He drank some beer and patted his mouth with a napkin . " And look at the Irish Queens-all set for a glorious reign and then along comes Hitler . The war was a massive interruption for dogs and trains . Both were crucial-they were training Labs to parachute , for God 's sake-but no one was bothering with breeding or engineering or any of the niceties . Even the King forgot about his kennels . " <p> " You ca n't call the war an interruption in dog breeding , " Elspeth said . " Millions of people died . " <p> " Of course , " her father said patiently . " Have some more chicken ? Parsnips ? " He pushed dishes in her direction . " Do you have any suggestions what I can give Agnes ? " <p> " Well , I was just in Marks and Sparks looking at nightdresses . She 's not exactly going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things might be important . " <p> " That 's a good idea . Suppose you get a nightdress and I get a dressing gown ? This stuff is vile , is n't it ? " he said , raising his glass . <p> A fortnight later they gathered at Agnes 's for Christmas . Walter and Elspeth drove up from Perth ; Christine and her family came down from Aberdeen . The sale of Mafeking had proceeded with astonishing speed , and it would be their last visit . Agnes , however , was determined that the occasion should not be elegiac . Smaller and less vigorous than Flora , she shared her sister 's buoyant humor . Most of the furniture had already been sold , to buy their presents , she joked . On Christmas Eve Elspeth lay in bed in the spare room , staring at the ghostly shape on the wallpaper where the wardrobe had stood on every previous visit , and thought of Barry . <p> One of their favorite activities when they first got together had been to drive round Perth , picking out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barry suggested ; this one for the garden , Elspeth said . The optimism of these outings had shed its radiance over her many solitary evenings . She had never doubted then that they would soon be living happily ever after . Only since her mother 's death , so abrupt , so unexpected , had she begun to question whether Barry would ever leave his family . <p> The evening before , they had met at the pub where she had gone with Flora after the Odeon . Elspeth had been determined to be cheerful but as Barry described taking his children to Aladdin she had sunk into a state of gloom . She scarcely laughed at his impersonation of the Dame and when she gave him his present , a book about Mary , Queen of Scots , she could not stop herself from saying , " You can pretend to have bought it for yourself . " <p> " Elspeth , " he said , squeezing her knee under the table . " I 'm sorry . You 're so much a part of my life , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkened and it was her turn to clown and tell him that their love life was way ahead of Mary 's . <p> The sound of a door creaking , followed by soft footsteps , interrupted her reverie . One of Christine 's daughters , Elspeth guessed , going in search of her parents . Was Lego a good gift ? she pondered , and fell asleep . <p> Next morning she found herself too busy to be sad . She acted as souschef for her father and Agnes and took the girls to the recreation ground . At Christmas dinner everyone got a little teary but afterwards they played the boisterous games Flora had loved , charades and hunt the thimble , until they were giddy with laughter . Elspeth drank one more glass of whisky before bed and slept soundly . <p> On Boxing Day she and Christine were in the parlor , packing the last of Agnes 's books , when Christine asked about the Gordon twins . It was their first opportunity for private conversation . " Dad says they 're moving into his spare room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Elspeth was trying to fit the complete works of Scott into a single box . " I was hoping he 'd forgotten . " <p> " Why oh , dear ? " ' said Christine , passing her Ivanhoe . " The boys can keep an eye on him . " <p> " These are n't just any boys . They 're hooligans . " She described the twins , emphasizing their taste in music and haircuts . <p> Christine kept handing her books . " I see what you mean , " she said , " but Dad nearly died last May . Unless you 're prepared to visit him every day , I think this is a good arrangement . You have enough problems of your own . " <p> Elspeth looked at her sister , her hair hanging down her back like a girl 's . She had inherited their mother 's refusal to fret , and fate in turn had dealt kindly with her ; she had an affectionate husband , two spirited daughters , and an excellent job . Sometimes Elspeth longed to tell her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life-a dead-end job , neither husband nor children in sight-made sense because of him . But no sooner did she imagine such a speech than she also imagined her sister 's easy manner vanishing . All she could hear was Christine calling her a home-wrecker , urging her to give him up . <p> It was mid-January before Elspeth again paid her father a Saturday afternoon visit . From the top of the street , she saw his brightly lit livingroom window . His was the only house in the terrace without lace curtains . Flora had thought them suburban . Let people look in , she had said . Marie Antoinette , Walter had teased . Now he answered the door , wearing his usual gray trousers with a navy-blue sweatshirt , an astonishingly casual garment for him . As Elspeth crossed the threshold she realized the chilly smell of solitude was gone ; it had been replaced by the odor of toast mixed with something else , sharp and seductive . <p> In the living room the fire blazed and on either side , in her parents ' armchairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haircuts , the sides shaved short , the top a little longer . Like her father they wore sweatshirts . Raymond was making a model train , the pieces spread out on a newspaper around his feet . The sharp smell was glue . " Hi , " he said , " how are you ? " <p> Elspeth nodded , speechless . Her father had told her on the phone that the twins had moved in but that did not lessen the shock of their presence . Justin had his Walkman on . Without a word he rose and headed for the kitchen . Her father pulled out one of the four hard chairs round the table for her , another for himself . " Did you have a good New Year ? " he asked . <p> " Yes , I went to Comrie . It was amazing . So many people . The bonfires . . . " She trailed off . Somehow Barry had escaped his family and what she recalled of the evening was not the fiery celebrations but his kisses . <p> Fortunately her father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times . She loved it , said it was the pagan side of Scotland . " <p> " How about the Orkneys ? " suggested Raymond , gently manipulating two pieces of his model . <p> " You mean Up Helliyar ? That really is pagan , burning the Viking boat . " <p> He was talking about Skara Brae when Justin returned with tea . " Thank you , Jus , " he beamed . He poured the tea , carried mugs over to the two boys and passed one to Elspeth . He resumed his seat and asked how things were at the office . <p> " Oh , we 've been having crises . Remember Deena , the new assistant ? Last week I discovered thirty-five pounds missing from the petty cash . We 're going to let her go . " She was talking to her father but in a slightly artificial way that acknowledged the twins . As part of the process of dismissal , she explained , she had given Deena a warning the day before . " Though I 'm not sure she got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walter . <p> " That I was warning her . I listed various problems with her work . She agreed , even volunteered that her typing was lousy . Then she said she and her boyfriend were having difficulties and I ended up sympathizing . " <p> " But you did tell her she was making mistakes ? " <p> Before she could reply , Raymond interrupted . " That 's chronic , " he burst out . " I mean you 're warning her just so you can say you 've kept the rules but you 're going to give her the boot anyway . How would you like to be treated like that ? " <p> " It does sound a little unfair , " her father said . " What if she improves ? " " What about the money ? " Elspeth protested . " Even if she turns into the world 's most brilliant secretary , there 's thirty-five pounds missing . " It was on the tip of her tongue to say something about Marks and Spencer . Just because the boys colluded with thieves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you ever heard that people are innocent until proven guilty ? " Raymond said . " You 're believing the worst of her because it 's convenient to have one person be all the bad things . Anyone could have taken the money . You could have . Or someone could have made a mistake counting it to begin with . " He glared at her and his nose ring flashed . On the other side of the fire Justin took off his earphones . <p> Her father tugged at the neck of his sweatshirt . " I think Raymond is right . If you believe she took the money , you should tell her and give her a chance to respond . " <p> " I agree , " said Justin . <p> " It 's really up to Barry , " Elspeth muttered . <p> " Barry , " said her father , " eats out of your hand . " <p> Like the boys , he was watching her fiercely . To avoid their combined scrutiny , she stood up and went over to the window . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trains and a typed list . Her eyes fell upon the first item . " We will attend school for all of every schoolday and we will do our homework . Walter will be available each evening to help with homework . " This must be the contract her father had spoken of , between him and the twins . Quickly she stepped back . <p> " I spoke to Agnes yesterday , " she said . " She seems very happy at the home . " <p> " As I suspected , " said her father . " It suits her to a T. Raymond and I took the train up to see her last week . He 's thinking of volunteering at Help the Aged . " <p> " He is ? " she said , not troubling to hide her incredulity and at the same time wondering why Agnes had failed to mention Raymond 's visit . Raymond held up the model engine and made motions in her direction . " I like older people . They 're less judgmental . " <p> Justin offered more tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop her . As she walked down the street , Mrs. Bouldrey waved from her window . How horrified she must be to have the twins as neighbors , Elspeth thought , and waved back . <p> It was after six and in the empty High Street bedraggled garlands of holly and ivy rustled between the lampposts , but she was too busy plotting the twins ' departure to notice . Their motives for wanting to live with her father were easy enough to understand-the comforts of home without the constraints-but his eluded her . What else but a minor breakdown could have led him to seek the company of the kind of boys who had made his last years of teaching a misery ? <p> Elspeth had witnessed that misery firsthand . When she was fifteen the minor public school where her father had taught for most of his adult life suddenly closed down , and he had been forced to take a job in the boys ' half of the school she and Christine attended . The two halves were so separate that at first the only difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school bus . Then Christine left for St. Andrews University and that summer Agnes , who did bed-and-breakfast during the tourist season , invited Elspeth to help at Mafeking . Elspeth accepted eagerly , imagining a life filled with friends and parties , overlooking the minor detail that she knew no one in Pitlochry . After watching her mope for a week , Agnes introduced her to David and Elsie . David was the minister 's son and besides , Agnes added , you all go to the same school . <p> Elspeth had never knowingly laid eyes on either boy before but she was thrilled . They were a year older and shared a mutual passion for theater . David was pale and foxy faced and saw himself as a director . Elsie was the actor , plump-cheeked and sweeter . His nickname came from his initials , Lyndsay Charles , and the coincidence of his and Elspeth 's names pleased all three of them . When they asked about her father , she tried to indicate by her monosyllabic answers that he was no more closely related to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to the manse and joined David and Elsie in the garden shed . In the musty gloom they talked , the boys smoked , and they read plays , greedily , as if they lived in a country where literature was illegal . They devoured Beckett , Osborne , Orton , Pinter , Albee , Genet , Miller . Sometimes David provided refreshments : crisps and ginger beer . He and Elsie relieved themselves in the shrubbery , well out of Elspeth 's sight and hearing . She drank sparingly and when she could no longer stand it , went home to Agnes and the bathroom , which she cleaned each morning . One afternoon Elsie went to the dentist and in a bored way David kissed her . Next day Elsie was back and they read Loot as if nothing had happened . <p> In September Elspeth and her father returned to school . With Christine gone , the weight of his presence fell squarely upon her . She hated climbing out of his car in front of the girls ' school each morning , and when the Latin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was surprised at such behavior from Mr. Clark 's daughter . Elspeth begged to be allowed to take the school bus again and eventually her parents gave in . <p> Besides escaping her father , the bus was a chance to see David and Elsie who , as weekly boarders , traveled twice a week from Pitlochry to Crieff and back again . The firm segregation , however-girls at the front , boys at the rear-made conversation difficult . A month passed before David spoke to her . As they were getting off , he muttered , " Meet us up the Knock . " <p> " I ca n't , " she said . " When ? " <p> The sky was relentlessly overcast but only an outright downpour would have prevented her from keeping the assignation . As soon as lessons ended she set off towards the Knock , the knob-shaped hill behind the town . A track led from the last houses up to the tree line . She found David and Elsie at the top . They wandered through the fir trees until they found a clearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " giggled Elsie , tossing back his fringe . <p> David produced a packet of Embassy and took out a spindly , homerolled cigarette . " Do you know what this is ? " <p> " A cigarette ? " <p> The boys laughed , pleased by her ignorance . Then David lit up . Elspeth had never even said the word " marijuana " but in the dark woods she recognized the smell instantly . When Elsie held out the joint , she hesitated . " Oh , come on , " said David . " Have a drag . " <p> She shook her head and David took it in her stead . There was no element of calculation in her refusal . She did not smoke cigarettes and for some reason she was not quite ready to plunge into this . They began to talk about the school play , a lamentably old-fashioned production of Pride and Prejudice . The joint was almost gone when David said , " Your Dad is a weird bloke . You know on his tests he gives boys a mark for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now boys , " croaked Elsie , " I am not an English teacher but I will not have you misspelling your own names . I simply will not . " As he and David doubled over , Elspeth realized that Elsie was imitating her father . The blood rose in her cheeks . She peered at her watch and muttered something about the six o'clock bus . The boys were laughing so hard they did not even say goodbye . On the nearly empty bus she chose a seat near the back . Marijuana . Just to have been in its presence was an honor . Then she remembered Elsie 's imitation . He had captured her father 's raspy voice perfectly . " Now boys , " she mouthed , and looked around to see if anyone had heard . <p> A few weeks after this rendezvous , Elspeth was in chemistry when she happened to glance out of the laboratory window , which faced the boys ' school , and saw a gray trousered leg emerge from the back window of her father 's classroom . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a second followed . <p> Desperately Elspeth turned her attention back to the equation Mr. Laing was sketching on the blackboard . She hoped her absorption might act as a shield , rendering what was happening outside invisible , but already several other girls had noticed . Soon everyone was staring out of the window . " Cripes , did you see those guys ? " whispered Jane Adams , blinking her protuberant eyes . <p> The boys dusted off their trousers and strolled down the drive . A few minutes later they reappeared , each carrying a brown paper bag . They had been to the tuck-shop , just beyond the school gates . And then , as they drew near , Elspeth recognized David and Elsie . To her horror , they climbed back through the window . The girls in her class burst into suppressed giggles . <p> That evening she watched her father closely . Talking over his day with her mother , he said , " The blighters were up to their tricks again . " For a moment she thought he had spotted David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a cartoon Donald Ross had done of him . He drew a copy of it for Flora and they both laughed . Stupid , Elspeth wanted to shout , do n't you know they take the mickey out of you every chance they get ? <p> Her next encounter with David and Elsie was the end-of-term Christmas dance . For weeks beforehand she had worried about being a wallflower , and when she entered the school gym to find the boys and girls on opposite sides of the room , only the presence of her friend Penny prevented immediate flight . It soon became apparent , however , that Elspeth 's problems were of a different order . The first dance was announced , a Gay Gordons , and Elsie asked her . The second dance struck up and David was there . The Dashing White Sergeant , done in threesomes , came as a relief . Together they circled the hall with comparative ease . As the final chords fell away , David said , " You 're staying in Crieff tonight , are n't you ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go of both their hands . <p> Elspeth began to feel a kind of panic . Penny was doing very nicely with Donald Ross and Helen , her hostess for the night , was entirely taken up with the lanky Peter Quick . But whenever she danced with Elsie , she sensed David following their progress . And vice versa . At ten thirty , with only two dances left , she dragged Penny into the cloakroom . " What shall I do ? " she demanded . " Whichever one I dance with , the other is right there . " <p> " Who do you like ? " asked Penny practically . <p> " I 'm not sure . Either . Both . David 's a bit sarcastic , but he is clever . Elsie 's nicer but a little wet . " <p> Penny took out a lipstick and leaned towards the mirror . " Elspeth , you do n't know how lucky you are . Suppose we toss a coin . Heads , Elsie ; tails , David . " <p> " I ca n't do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , ' I like you more than him . ' It 's so rude . " <p> " Well , " Penny turned , lips glistening , " there 's your answer . Let them choose . Now I 've got to get back to Donald . " She swished out of the cloakroom . <p> Elspeth re-entered the gym and danced a boisterous version of Strip the Willow with Elsie . When the music ended , it no longer seemed absolutely necessary to separate by gender , and David joined them . " I 'm dying for a fag , " he said . <p> " Perhaps a special fag , " said Elsie . <p> They were still snickering as the lights dimmed for the last waltz and David pulled her to him . They began to shuffle round the room . The rule was everyone had to keep moving . Miss Novak and Mr. Spear , the two gym teachers , passed them , dancing with impressive flourish . " God , " muttered David and steered her to a more crowded part of the floor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'll be outside . " <p> In the cloakroom girls were bundling into their outdoor clothes with almost frantic haste . Penny rushed past and Helen hurried out . Elspeth sat down quietly to change into her boots . When she was ready , she went over to the mirror and gave herself a melodramatic stare . <p> In the street David and Elsie were leaning against a parked car . They sauntered down the shadowy pavement . " I noticed your Dad was n't one of the chaperones , " said Elsie . <p> " No , we live too far away . " <p> David laughed . " The only thing that got me through this evening was thinking what Genet would have made of it . Imagine Miss Novak as a man . " <p> " Or Mr. Spear as a woman , " chimed in Elsie . <p> Elspeth listened with bemused horror . They walked along the main road and , instead of turning off to the housing estate where Helen lived , kept going to the golf course . A dilapidated clubhouse marked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porch . There was a damp odor , reminiscent of the garden shed . The three of them leaned on the railing , David , Elspeth , then Elsie . The boys smoked a joint , passing it back and forth . After her first refusal they did not press her but the difference between smoking and not smoking seemed very tenuous . Presently she found herself saying , " You know a few weeks ago I thought I saw the two of you climbing out of my Dad 's classroom . " <p> " We did , " crowed Elsie , " right in the middle of calculus . " <p> " And he never had a clue , " added David . <p> " We had a bet , " Elsie continued . " With Hugo Sinclair . He cooked a meal during algebra . " He faded into laughter . <p> " Cooked a meal ? " <p> " Yes , " spluttered David , " he brought in one of those camping stoves . Baked beans , eggs , toast . " <p> Gradually they filled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughing wildly and just when she began to be afraid she would never stop , Elsie kissed her . He did not touch her in any other way , only his mouth on hers , his tongue flicking between her lips . Then he stepped back and David took his place . He put his hand on the back of her neck , under her hair ; she opened her mouth to his deep kiss . <p> This happened several times before she did pull away , from Elsie , she thought . On the first tee the marker glowed . Elsie let out his breath in a sigh and she heard David fumbling with his cigarettes . " Whew , " he said . " This is better than any stunt of Hugo 's . Genet would have loved us . " <p> " Mr. Clark , you 've got a lovely daughter , " sang Elsie . " Mr. Clark , you 've . . " <p> But Elspeth was already running over the damp ground to the golf course gate and the main road . Her mother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dancing . Mr. Clark , rapped her boots against the pavement , daughter . Mr. Clark , daughter , Mr. Clark , daughter . <p> On Monday Elspeth asked her father for a lift home from school . She pretended to study the newspaper until they were safely past the golf course . Then she told him that two boys had been smoking marijuana . <p> His long face seemed to lengthen . " You 're certain about this ? " he said . " It was n't just a fancy cigarette ? " <p> In an effort to dispel his doubt , Elspeth did what she had not entirely planned-she named the boys . " David Martin and Elsie Kennard , " she said . " They were the ones who smoked it . " <p> They were behind a timber lorry and she stared aghast at the neatly sawn tree trunks , waiting for her father 's praise . But he was making a tsk , tsk sound . " Poor boys . Do n't tell anyone . I 'll have a word with a couple of people and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days later , on the last day of term , Elspeth had an interview with Mr. Strathearn , a local solicitor and school governor . He already knew the names and she had merely to nod as he repeated her story . " And , Elspeth , you 'll forgive me asking , but did you smoke ? Even by mistake ? " <p> " No , I did n't touch it . " <p> " You 're a fine girl , " said Mr. Strathearn . <p> From her point of view that was the end of the matter . Agnes came to them for Christmas and when the new term started she caught a lift with her father on Monday mornings and Friday afternoons . One snowy afternoon in late January she was taking a shortcut down Blacksmith 's Lane when she rounded a corner and came face to face with David and Elsie . They stopped . So did she . The snow fell gently on their dull gray uniforms . Elspeth stared at the boys in amazement . She had imagined expulsion or eternal detention but after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Bitch , " hissed David , and she scuttled by . <p> Now , thought Elspeth , her father needed saving again . The first step in her campaign against the twins was to talk to him alone , no easy task unless she took time off work during school hours . Instead she proposed a visit to Agnes for Sunday lunch . " Good idea , " said Walter , " we can take the train . " They met at the station and Elspeth saw to her relief that he had shed the sweatshirt and was back in his suit and raincoat . While she bought the tickets he went ahead , and when she joined him on the platform he was in a state of high glee . Due to engineering works they had a Class 50 engine . " Justin and Raymond will be beside themselves , " he said . " We 've been trying to spot a Hoover for months . " <p> On the train he left her to read the newspaper and went in search of the guard . He returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , rather than the three-forty-seven , there was a good chance of scoring another rare engine . Before Elspeth could bring up more important topics , he was paging through his train-spotters ' guide . She bided her time . <p> In less than half an hour they climbed down at Pitlochry Station . She suggested a taxi but Walter insisted on walking . " That way I can eat a bigger lunch . " <p> As she fell in beside him , Elspeth realized that he was referring to more than the normal equation between exercise and food : namely , his own intricate balancing act with diabetes . <p> The sheltered housing was a modem sandstone building on the south side of town , a short distance from Mafeking . Agnes introduced them to the other residents-already she was on friendly terms with everyoneand the three of them sat down to roast beef and yorkshire pudding . Walter talked about the twins ; Justin 's talent for computer science , how Raymond was working for Help the Aged on Saturdays . Had there ever , Elspeth wondered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her ? <p> " I 'm sorry they did n't come with you , " said Agnes . " Mr. Taylor is always asking about Raymond . " She explained to Elspeth that Raymond had made a highly favorable impression by rescuing Mr. Taylor 's cat , Tinkerbell , from a tree . <p> After lunch they went into the lounge and discovered a curious silence reigning . On all sides the elderly inhabitants of the home had slid into sleep as swiftly as if the yorkshire pudding had been made with sleeping pills instead of flour . Agnes and Walter each chose a section of the newspaper and settled themselves in adjacent armchairs . Behind the dignified screen of world events they too were about to succumb to the arms of Morpheus . They barely nodded when Elspeth said she was going for a walk . <p> Outside , the gray afternoon was closing in . Most of the cars had on their headlights . She walked down the street and turned into Agnes 's cul-de-sac . There stood Mafeking . In the living room , where only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , strangers were watching television . Already the new owners had painted the front door red and hung a blind at the kitchen window . <p> The rapid transformation made her hurry on and she found herself heading towards the manse . She had not been there for years but even the boot-scraper by the front door looked the same . When she peered cautiously into the garden , the shed was a little more overgrown , the door hanging lopsided from its hinges . What had become of David and Elsie , she wondered . The last time she saw either of them had been in the school play . It had been The Importance of Being Earnest and Elsie 's performance as Lady Bracknell had reduced her parents to sobs of laughter . Elspeth had sat beside them , longing for a trapdoor to open and swallow her up . <p> Back at the sheltered housing Agnes had set out tea and cakes . She would accept no refusal . " Walter , you know you like Garibaldis , " she urged . " Elspeth , you 're skinny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your boyfriend . " <p> Walter dutifully took a Garibaldi . Elspeth helped herself to a slice of Battenburg and asked if Agnes knew what David Martin was doing these days . " Now let me see . " Agnes frowned over her own Battenburg . " His father moved to a parish in Edinburgh and I did hear David had gone the same way . " <p> " Gone the same way ? " Elspeth echoed . <p> " Become a minister . Not Church of Scotland but Buddhist or something . His order bought one of those islands . They run a monastery and a hotel . " <p> Her father took a bite of Garibaldi and offered his belief that monasteries were the ideal landowners . " They 're quiet and they work hard to preserve the flora and fauna . " <p> " Fauna , " said Agnes . " Goodness , that takes me back . You know that 's what Flora used to call me as a girl . She had everyone doing it for a while , even our teachers . I miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Elspeth stared at the crumbs on her plate and thought longingly of her mother . When she was training dogs , Flora had often brought them up to Pitlochry to teach them about traffic . Now Elspeth pictured her striding across the checked carpet of the sheltered housing , a pair of wellington boots in one hand , a dog leash in the other . With what gusto she would have eaten lunch and teased Agnes about her waistline before organizing them to walk down to the recreation ground . Her death seemed not merely sad but an affront to the natural order of things . <p> The summer before her father started teaching at Elspeth 's school , one of her mother 's Labs had fallen sick . They had been on their way to a dog show in Abderdeen , Flora , Elspeth and the dogs , when from the back of the car came a series of groans . They had pulled over and found Daisy panting and glassy-eyed ; normally the most docile of dogs , she had bared her teeth . Flora drove the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enclosure she parked in the first empty space . " Find Tam , " she said , giving Elspeth a little shove . <p> Elspeth had tried the main tent . They were in the midst of showing the pastoral breeds but Tam was nowhere to be seen . Then she went to check the other car park in the next field . As she came through the gate , she saw him standing facing a sycamore off to one side . In her haste , she did not think what his posture might mean . She ran over . <p> " Tam , Daisy 's ill . Mum said can you come at once . " <p> He turned , still peeing . " First things first , " he said . <p> Elspeth fell back on the protection of a shiny Volvo . Her familiarity with animal activity did not make the sight of him less shocking . It was her first glimpse that the people around her , grownups , classmates , even herself , had a more complicated relationship to their bodies than she had imagined . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over , hands in pockets . " Lead on , MacDuff , " he said . <p> When they got back to the car , Daisy was standing unsteadily , with Dusk , her littermate , hovering beside her . " Tam , " Flora exclaimed . " Thank goodness . " <p> Elspeth stepped away , eager to escape to the refreshment tent , but Flora asked her to wait in case they needed her to fetch or carry . She leaned against the front of the car , reading her comic , trying to ignore the panting dog . <p> " She was fine last night , " she heard her mother say . " Fine this moming . This started just past Forfar . " <p> " Och , aye , " said Tam . " Doubtless she ate something , poor lass , see her tongue , but she 's already on the mend . " <p> Elspeth climbed deeper into her story , about a girl , Fay , whose father falls off a ladder , leaving her to run the family bakery . No one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk the night before she had taken Daisy to visit the clump of Deadly Nightshade she had discovered near the old well and that she either had , or had not , allowed Daisy to briefly sniff the bright berries . Read , she told herself . Fay was learning to make cinnamon rolls . Do n't listen to the grownups . <p> True to Tam 's prediction , Daisy did recover-she emptied two bowls of water and fell into a peaceful sleep-and Elspeth wrapped the events of the day , all the events , in a huge blanket of forgetfulness which she seldom twitched aside . <p> By the time Elspeth and Walter said goodbye to Agnes and set off for the station , it was fully dark . The street was empty save for a pack of teenagers loitering outside the off-license . Her father asked about Deena . Had she heeded Elspeth 's warning ? <p> " She 's doing better . We 've only had one complaint in the last week , and she stays late to check through her work . " <p> " So that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It means we can give her a reference , but Barry plans to let her go at the end of the month . " <p> " I thought you were the office manager . " " Barry has the final say , " Elspeth said . " We 're not a huge company , there are just five of us . " <p> " Still , " said her father , " it 's a terrible thing to accuse someone falsely . " They were passing the fishmongers ; white trays edged with plastic parsley waited for the next day 's catch . Last Friday when she had been too busy to go for lunch Deena had brought her a shrimp-and-cucumber sandwich . She had brushed aside offers of payment and lectured Elspeth on the importance of regular meals . Later that afternoon Elspeth had reminded Barry he must give her notice next week . <p> " Whatever you say , " he had said . In a year his youngest child would start school and he would , he claimed , at last feel free . Meanwhile she had seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ openness she had forgotten . <p> The train back to Perth was , as predicted , pulled by another old engine . When her father finished his raptures , Elspeth said there was something she wanted to discuss with him . They were sitting facing each other . He folded his arms and said calmly , " You want to talk about Raymond and Jus , do n't you ? I could see how uncomfortable you were with them last week . " <p> " It 's not that I 'm uncomfortable . I think the whole business of them moving in with you is wrong . " <p> " Wrong ? Tell me how . " <p> " They 're just using you , eating you out of house and home , getting you to do their homework and take care of them , and then they 're going to bugger off and leave you . " <p> " That does n't sound so different from my own children . From all children . I left home at seventeen . Could n't wait and never went back . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again his voice was so soft she had to lean forward to hear him . " It may not have occurred to you but I taught boys for forty years because I like them . Your mother liked dogs and I liked boys , even the bad ones who made fun of me . That was how it was . Now Justin and Raymond are a reprieve . They do n't treat me as if I 'm old , they do n't make exceptions for me . Maybe you ca n't understand that , Elspeth . You 've always been such a puritan . " <p> Before she could answer , his breathing deepened and he was asleep . She stared out of the window at the occasional lights of cars and houses , enraged . What did he mean such a puritan ? If he knew about Barry , he 'd change his mind in a hurry . Then she wondered if he might have been thinking of David and Elsie . After her meeting with Mr. Strathearn her father had never mentioned the marijuana again but somehow she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She could not tell him the one thing that would vindicate her : the way the boys mocked him . You were the one who needed police protection , she thought . <p> They were nearing Perth when she pulled herself away from the hypnotic darkness and looked back at her father . At once she knew something was awry . His eyes were still closed but no longer in sleep . He was slumped against the window and his face , beneath the stark lighting of the train , was the color of whey . She reached across and tugged his sleeve . " Dad , " she said . " Walter . " <p> He grunted faintly . <p> She jumped up and ran down the nearly empty train . At last she found the guard , a ginger-haired man reading the sports pages of the paper . She stammered out that her father was ill . " What sort of ill ? " he said , seizing his walkie-talkie . He seemed pleased by this call to action . <p> " He has diabetes . I think he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurried down the train . Walter was as she had left him . All those cakes , she thought . Awkwardly she went through his pockets , hoping to find medicine or instructions . There was only his train-spotters ' guide . <p> The guard spoke into the walkie-talkie and after listening to a crackling response said , " We 'll be there in five minutes . We 'll get an ambulance and have him at the hospital in ten . " <p> As they rolled into Perth Station he co-opted a young man from the next carriage to help lift her father off the train . Together they maneuvered him onto the platform . A trolley was standing nearby and they made their way towards it , Walter hanging limply between them . <p> " Where 's the ambulance ? " Elspeth said . " I thought it would be here . " <p> Her voice was loud and shaky . The twilight of the station made her feel she could easily have overlooked an ambulance or two . Then a hand touched her shoulder . " Elspeth , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> He held out the black pouch containing her father 's insulin and needles . " Thank God . " She was reaching towards the bag when she realized she had no idea how to give an injection . She stared at Raymond , wideeyed . " I ca n't do it . " <p> " No , " he said comfortably , " but we can . Jus and I made him teach us . We only discovered half an hour ago that he 'd left his insulin , else we 'd have phoned . " <p> He stepped around her . His brother was already bent over the supine body . Justin unbuttoned Walter 's coat , tugged up his shirt , and undid his trousers . She glimpsed the secret white flesh of her father 's belly . " Go and get a cup of tea , " Raymond said , holding up the syringe to the light . <p> " Plenty of sugar . " <p> By the time she came back her father , once again fully dressed , was talking to Raymond and Jus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he whispered , " but the engineer told me they 'd refurbished the valves . " <p> " Here 's the tea , " she said . <p> " Well , drink it , " said Raymond . <p> " Is n't it for Dad ? " she asked , bewildered . <p> Raymond shook his head , smiling slightly . " We 'll get him some in a few minutes . No , if he needs insulin , then more sugar is the last thing to give him . " <p> He turned back to her father and Elspeth sank down on the far end of the trolley . As she sipped the sweet , strong , institutional tea , she was overwhelmed by her own stupidity and treachery . <p> Next morning she was locking her car outside her father 's when a voice called her name . Mrs. Bouldrey trotted towards her , towed by a panting corgi . " How 's Walter ? " she asked . " Heel , Rusty . " <p> Elspeth told her the hospital had sent him home with a warning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Mrs. Bouldrey , " just grand . He was so good after Flora died . A week later he came round to ask for a recipe for macaroni and cheese . I 've never seen anyone with so little self-pity . " She was still nodding emphatically as the inexorable Rusty dragged her away . " Let me know if I can help , " she cried . <p> The twins had left for school and for the first time Elspeth used the key her father had given her . Shyly she climbed the stairs to his bedroom . He was sitting up in bed , wearing rumpled blue pajamas . She noticed he kept to the side where he had always slept with her mother ; the newspaper lay abandoned beside him . " Dad , " she said , " how are you feeling ? " <p> " Exhausted . As if I 'd been swimming the channel . " <p> She was close enough to see the truth of his remark . His face was still pale and the lower rims of his eyes seemed to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'll make some tea , " she said . As she waited for the kettle to boil , she looked around for something to do , but the breakfast dishes were washed , the plants watered , the coal scuttle full . A note from Raymond on the table told her what to give Walter for lunch and listed the phone number of the school . When she carried the tea upstairs , her father had fallen asleep . <p> She tiptoed away again and stopped in the hall to phone the office . Deena answered , her warm voice making even the name of the company sound inviting . Elspeth explained she was taking the day off and why . " I 'm so sorry , " Deena said . " Is there anything I can do ? Do you need groceries ? " <p> " No , thanks , " Elspeth said , and hung up before she could offer more sympathy . <p> She stood there , looking at the half-stripped wallpaper . Cold air rushed through the letter box , nipping at her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what did that make Elsie ? An accountant ? They had kissed her because they liked her ; they had kissed her to make fun of her father . Those were the two banks of the river and the truth lay bobbing in the muddy water somewhere between , not too far from her own dubious motives for reporting the marijuana . <p> She thought about the missing thirty-five pounds and all the strangers who ambled through their office : window cleaners , photocopy repairmen , clients . This afternoon she would phone Barry . <p> She was sitting in Justin 's armchair when she heard footsteps on the stairs . The door opened . Her father , still in pajamas , stared at her from the doorway . <p> " Christ , " he said , " you 're the image of Flora . " <p> A feathery feeling passed over Elspeth . Her father shook his head and came and settled himself in Raymond 's chair . <p> After a moment he spoke again . " You know , Elspeth , you do n't have the brains you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tormented by his narrow brush with death and her nearly fatal ineptitude . Now she felt compelled to justify herself . It had been his idea to take the later train . He had never told her about the insulin . As soon as she realized something was wrong , she had fetched help . " I did my best , " she said . <p> " Not that . " He gazed into the fire . " You did everything fine . No , that was my doltishness , too many cakes and the chance to see a warship , but at least it was only a day . Whereas this business with Barry has been going on for years . " <p> " What do you mean ? " The words were out before she could stop them any more than the blush that spread across her cheeks . He was speaking as if her hard-kept secret were a well-known fact . <p> " Do n't , " he said , waving a hand dismissively . " Think of it as part of my convalescence that I just want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to argue about whether to tell you we knew . Flora hated to see you tie yourself in knots to find excuses but Christine always said we must n't intrude . " <p> He sighed , nostalgic perhaps for those lost arguments , but Elspeth was too busy , racing round the rooms of the past-moving a sofa here , opening a curtain there , rolling up a rug-to respond . She remembered Christine remarking over the collected works of Scott that she had enough problems . She remembered her father saying that Barry ate out of her hand . Even Agnes 's joke about building her up for her boyfriend took on new meaning . The thought of her own obtuseness made Elspeth want to climb into a small , dark place . Yet at the same time a kind of exhilaration was coursing through her . Her father had given her something she craved , something she had believed impossible : from beyond the grave her mother 's understanding . Flora had known all she kept hidden and loved her anyway . <p> Once , soon after Walter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gordon twins to watch an express train . At the first faint rumblings they had lined up on the platform : the boys teetering near the edge , she and her father at a more cautious distance . The sound grew and grew until , quite suddenly , the carriages were hurtling by , filling their clothes with wind and their eyes with scorched light . As in the presence of a storm or a waterfall , everything inessential was stripped away , and when the train disappeared they were all four standing there , laughing . Was it only her imagination that now in his armchair her father 's white hair lifted with the passing wind ? <p> 
##1003661 HISTORY , a description or recital of things as they are , or have been , in a continued orderly narration of the principal facts and circumstances thereof . History , with regard to its subject , is divided into the History of Nature and the History of Actions . The History of Actions is a continued relation of a series of memorable events . -Encyclopaedia Britannica , first edition ( 1769-71 ) <p> The book was auburn , with black , slanted letters on the spine reading Spies of WW II , and , impressed onto the front cover , black letters , tiny trenches , with golden brims , reading : The Greatest Spies of World War Two . The book was big and weighty . I 'd put it on my knees , but then its weight would spread my legs and the book would close itself and slip to the floor . And I 'd lie on my belly and rest my head on the scaffold of my hands and read . When my elbows would begin to ache , I 'd recline my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other half , feeling the sticky moisture connecting my cheek and a spy 's face , secrets of WW II just inches away from my absorbing pupils . There were lots of black-and-white pictures : a five-man column-surrounded by soldiers pointing rifles-with their hands on the napes of their necks : when I would narrow my eyes , they 'd look like black and white butterflies ; the head of a chubby member of the Rote Kapelle , l with an asymmetrical face : nose slightly on the left side , right eye hardly opened and seemingly asleep , mouth kept shut with effort , as if there was a spring of blood behind the feeble lips-I just knew from his face that his hands ( swollen wrists , bloody , burning trenches under the cuffs ) were handcuffed ; a picture of General Montgomery and a picture of General Montgomery 's doppelganger , side by side : General Montgomery standing , arms akimbo , turned sideways , looking at the upper left corner of the page , with the timeless beret parallel with his gaze ; General Montgomery 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odd pensiveness , as if painfully aware that he could never be General Montgomery ; a row of blindfolded people in white in front of the ready firing squad and a smiling officer , his right arm raised , pointing at the upper right corner of the picture . And , near the end , there was Sorge " at the outset of his mission in Japan " 2-framed by a decor door behind his back , standing legs apart ( left foot NW , right foot NE ) in a dark trench coat , one hand pocketed , the other somewhat cramped , holding a purse or a camera case ; and his head : fiendish ears , large and illshaped ; lips shut tight , as if his teeth were biting the inside of his lower lip ; the wide-base triangle of his nose , its top angle connected , by two deep furrows , with two dark dots in the corners of his mouth ; lightless twin-holes , at the bottom of which were his obscure eyes ; and the blackinked helmet of hair . The picture was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else 's curtained body . One could see the sharp cut at the verge of his collar , where his head , guillotined in a shadowy laboratory , was attached to a headless trench coat-plus an inexplicable excess of neck-flesh on the left side.3 But I believed that Sorge was in that trench coat . I believed that he was about to enter the door-apparition behind his back . I believed in the totality of that picture , I believed in the apparent , and I trusted books . I was ten . In the winter of 1975 , I began to conceive the idea that my father4 was a spy . He had been pursuing a degree at the Leningrad Energy Institute and had often been away , going to Leningrad or Moscow5 or Siberia or wherever far away . On New Year 's Eve , 1975 , my father was in the middle of a blizzard , immobilized at the Moscow airport ; my mother6 was staring through the window , watching snowflakes parachuting on Sarajevo ; and I was patrolling our home , vaguely missing my father , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , St. Claus became Grandpa Frosty and used to arrive on New Year 's Eve ) at the very moment of his arrival and force him to exchange a plain fountain pen and a fluffy sweater ( both of which he had sent in advance ) for some spy-devices . A poisonous fountain pen , 7 a disguise kits ( with a fake mustache and contact lenses that could change the color of my eyes ) , a matchbox containing a micro-camera , and a cyanide ampoule , were on the list of my desires . Tired of patrolling and longing , I asked my mother what she would think if I became a spy and she said she would n't mind too much , but she would be afraid for me , just as she was afraid for my father and she said she would be lonely and sad if I changed my identity and forgot about her and she said she wanted me to be better than my father , not to be somewhere else all the time . That night , falling asleep by the plastic tree , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father being somewhere else , in a black trench coat , stealthily walking down a dark hall , stopping in front of a door , looking down the tunnel-like hall behind him , unlocking the door with something in his hand , entering the room ( my dreamy gaze passing , like a camera , through the wall , following him ) , finding the desk drawer in the darkness , turning on the desk lamp , turning it away from the window , breaking the lock of the top drawer , taking the matchbox out of his pocket , taking the file out , photographing the documents9 ( with blurred headings ) with the matchbox ( whose snapping I attempted to reproduce : " sllt sllt . " ) But wait , I hear footsteps , heavy thumping , I turn off the light , the footsteps stop before the door , I hide behind the curtain , the footsteps open the door , cut the darkness with the flashlight , like a sword , I 'm afraid that he ( she ? ) could smell my fear , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door is closed and everything is fine , but I do not dare to feel relieved . I uncurtain myself and continue photographing and then I hear a woman sobbing and there is another door and I open the door and a torrent of light rushes in , and a Japanese womanI0 says , with a sorrowful smile : " You must go to bed now . Go undress yourself . " From his journeys to the Soviet Union , my father would always bring me dull Soviet toys which all had a sour , oily smell : gray toy car ( Volga ) which was sticky when touched and produced a hideous high-pitched whining sound when ( seldom ) driven ; dun plastic train station , meant for my long-abandoned train ; military olive-green gun that ejected little ( vomit-orange ) plastic balls , instantly banned and then consequently disposed of by my mother ; a plethora of books about the victorious Red Army , ll which I could n't read since they were in Russian , but I liked the pictures ( plain peasant faces , scared stiff of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neutralized a German machine gun by throwing themselves at the barrel or who jumped , with clusters of hand grenades attached to their chests , into trenches full of terrified Germans . But at the beginning of 1975 , after three cold nights at the Moscow airport , he brought me something beyond words : a portable telegraphic system . It was in a gray ( naturally ) box with a thin booklet which had a smiling black-and-white boy with gigantic earphones on his head ( but no earphones in the box . ) My father unpacked it : two buzzer-keys and a coil of shining copper wire . Then he put one key in our dining room and the other one in the bedroom and connected them with the wire . He pressed the key in the bedroom ( buzz-buzzbuzz-buzz ) and the electric current ( he said ) carrying a Morse-encoded messagel2 went over the bedroom floor , passed my father 's curled socks ( he 'd take off his socks first thing when he got back home ) , went through the kitchen , speedily crawling by my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again ) , then diving under the carpet ( lest someone , most likely I , stumble over and fall onto the glass-top table to be " cut in pieces " ) of the dining room and then reached the key ( buzz-buzzbuzz-buzz ) in front of the amazed me . I could not decode the message , so I could not reply , which made me eager to learn Morse code . My father knew Morse code very well ( which fueled my suspicions ) so he decided to train me . He 'd tap messages at the dinner table ( my mother digging a crater in the mashed potatoes , and rolling her eyes ) and I 'd try to decode them , forgetting to chew and swallow , the mashed potatoes becoming liquid in my mouth . He 'd tap " hurry up " at the bathroom door , where I was getting carried away over a book . I was getting better , I even sent him a couple of simple messages ( " want dog " ) , but my father sustained his teaching patience only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then he was off to the Soviet Union again . I continued to practice Morse code for a while and was getting somewhat better , but than I abandoned practicing because it was boring to send messages into a void . Several times I played a whole spy game : I 'd sneak into my parents " bedroom ( my mother innocuously watching The Sound of Music ) , photograph the stuff in the top drawer , the unlocked one , of my father 's desk ( mainly bills ) with a matchbox ( a real matchbox ) , then I would crawl out of the bedroom , behind the back of my unsuspecting dozing Mother , and go to my secret shelter under the glass-top table , and send haplessly coded messages back to the bedroom , imagining that they meant something , picturing someone on the other end of the copper wire . It was all over when I shattered the glass-top table , almost beheading myself , while practicing seeing ( seeing clearly , I should say ) in the dark-a skill necessary , I believed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My mother terminated the telegraph line and I was left to send messages by telepathy ( a brief and only partly successful attempt ) . In April , my father came back from the Soviet Union and he brought me a too-light , atrociously deformed , pigskin soccer ball . When my mother went to the hospital to give birth to my little sister Hanna ( July 4 , 1975-January 31 , 1985 ) , my father was away , again . This time he was in Baku , the Soviet Republic of Azerbaidjan ( whence , in August , he brought me four tin oil-drill towers and a box of little pipes that would have formed a pipeline , had they ever been connected ) . I was left home alone for lengthy periods and was watched over all the time , I believed , by Comrade Tito himself . It was because Branko Vukelic had told me that one should n't use Tito 's name in vain , for Comrade Tito had TV monitors at his palace in Belgrade , on which he could see every single resident of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , " Branko Vukelic said , " if you use Tito 's name to swear and then you lie , or if you use Tito 's name to curse , he can see you . And if he sees you , he may decide to die and punish us all . " I was very careful thereafter not to swear , lest I be guilty of Comrade Tito 's ( or someone else 's , for that matter ) death . It was soothing to know , however , that I was being monitored , when I was all by myself , that if someone came to abduct me ( the police or the devil himself ) it would have been seen and I would have been , doubtless , retrieved from the sneaky villains . It also meant that I had to wash my hands after using the bathroom , could n't pick my nose and stick the snot to the underside of the chair , nor could I belch like a hog . I tried to locate the cameras that must have been transmitting images from our home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were superbly hidden , for I could n't find any . While Mother and Father were away , I looked into vases ; I looked behind the pictures on the wall , breaking the one showing them in Vienna on their honeymoon ( for which I was ruthlessly beaten when my mother came back from the hospital ) ; I looked into lamps and light switches ; I looked everywhere and the only place I could figure out as a camera location was the TV set ( model Futura ) . It was a perfectly logical location , for , from the position of the TV , almost every nook of our home was visible-in fact , everything in the apartment except Mother and Father 's bedroom . When I wanted to be alone , I 'd go to their bedroom and lie in their bed , smelling the ethereal residues of their absent bodies , watching their wedding picture on the opposite wall ( they 're smiling , with a circular lamp behind them acting the moon ) , still suspecting that there was a Tito 's camera behind their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Galician Front , where he became one of the best sharpshooters in his division , specia izing in eliminating enemy snipers . Photograph There were claims that a " Dr. Sorge , " said by the police to have been in Frankfurt in 1925 and 1926 , was not the mysterious Tokyo spy , " but someone else , of whom we know nothing . " Photograph Sorge 's wife , Yekaterina ( " Katcha " ) Maximova , standing over her two sisters . On his last trip to Moscow , in 1935 , Sorge visited Yekaterina , whom he was believed to have married , and who died in Siberia , in 1943 , her throat cut by a sharp piece of ice in the hand of a jealous workingunit leader . Photograph In the summer of 1965 , Hanako-san was invited to visit the Soviet Union . At the Black Sea resort of Yalta , she went to see a performance of Press Attache in Tokyo , a play dealing with Sorge 's life in Japan . <p> At the time of my poor sister 's birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father was a spy , but I had n't been able to find any tangible evidence . My suspicions had swollen because of Father 's long phone conferences in Russian with somebody who had never been identified ; because of letters ( in colorful envelopes embellished with eventful stamps ) coming from Moscow , Vladivostok , 14 Stockholm , New York ; because of his mysterious smiles , when he would be watching the news , as if he knew more than the bland announcers ; because of his comments about the politicians : " He wo n't last long , " or " He 's dead all right " ; because of his secluding himself behind the bedroom door and never letting anyone see what was he doing there . When Tito went to Cuba ( a TV image of Tito and Castro : hugging , their smiles stowed with false teeth : Tito in his white , elaborate fieldmarshal 's uniform , Castro in his olive-gray sergeant 's uniform plus the immortal curly beard ) I reckoned that I was n't going to be watched or , even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lower officials who would n't dwell over me as caringly as Tito himself would . Thus I decided to venture into going through my father 's drawers , closets , suits and suitcases , all conveniently located in the bedroom , out of the reach of Tito 's men . I even unplugged the already turned-off TV and put a thick ( Turkmenistan ) blanket over it . I took down , carefully , the wedding picture and rolled down the shades . First I went through ( two ) suitcases , finding ( two ) hotel brochures : the Lux15 in Moscow and a Holiday Inn in Vienna , with pictures of reception desks , desolate rooms and swimming pools . The Lux hotel brochure had a smiling Russian beauty ( silky braids , rosy cheeks , big eyes , et cetera ) on the front page . The Holiday Inn brochure had a picture of a spacious hall , with an immense chandelier , dissolved into glittering crystal tears , hanging from the top of the picture . I went through the inside suitcase pockets , finding business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; finding unintelligible notes on napkins and exhausted railway tickets ; finding a lighter ( a miniature camera ? No ! ) and a pack of Soviet cigarettes ( Sputnik , with an ostentatious picture of an ascending spaceship on the box ) ; finding mysterious rubber objects ( condoms , I was to find out , a couple of years later ) . Now I want the reader to assume the role of the camera , to move the lens towards me and peek over my shoulder , following my gaze . I want the camera to focus on the objects that I am about to uncover . I want the thrill of discovery to be rendered with the exactness of the detail . I want this to be documented . Turn on the light . Roll . The left closet . First , the underwear . You have to look under the neatly built pyramid of undershirts . Nothing . Under the panties .

What 's on the papers ? They look like documents ( headings blurred ) , they seem to be in Russian . Would you turn off that camera and leave the room please ; I need some privacy , I have just obtained proof that my father is a spy.21 Besides greasy toys ( for me ) and large cans of pickled fish ( for Mother ) my father brought stories from the U.S.S.R. : about his travels down the Volga River , passing by towns , one after the other , made of cubicles , factory smokestacks , and an enormous Lenin statue ( making a step forward , pointing towards the future ) ; about the greatest dam in the world , on the Yenisey River-watching the boiling river at the foot of the dam was " like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who rode purebred horses as if they 'd grown out of them ; about thousands of miles of taiga , where prehistoric creatures lived and where you 'd never be found if you were lost ; about places so cold that your blood would just stop flowing if you stopped moving ; about places where vodka was so cheap that nobody drank water . Many stories featured Professor Venykov-my father always referred to him as Professor Venykov , as if that were his Christian name . The stories of Venykov were stories of placidity : about long conversations by the perpetually warm samovar , with affordable caviare and pickled pike liver ; about walks down the Nevski Prospekt , while Russian children played hockey on the frozen Neva ; about Venykov reminiscing about his childhood : cherry orchards around Kiev , swimming in the Dnieper , fighting , at the age of nineteen , as a partisan in the last war ; 22 about his beautiful wife and two girls who were solving complicated mathematical problems when not playing piano-cello duets ; about chess games23 in the community sauna . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Soviet Union . In the late summer of 1976 , upon a fabricated invitation from the Sarajevo Micronet Research Institute ( which my father obtained through his connections ) , Professor Venykov came to visit us . He arrived at five o'clock in the morning , having driven non-stop , for sixteen hours , from Budapest to Sarajevo ( only a sip of vodka , once in a while , to keep him awake ) . He avoided ringing the bell and pusillanimously knocked at our door , not quite being there . Father and Mother hesitantly left the bed ( Mother taking Hanna in her arms ) , exchanging timorous glances , not being able to step out of their respective dreams . My father looked through the peephole ( " Professor Venykov ! " ) , opened the door and snatched him inside , looking down the hall before closing the door . They exchanged exclamations for a while ( Father : " Professor Venykov ! " Venykov : " Ay , moy Pyotr ! Moy Pyotr ! " ) then my father pointed towards my mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if opening the door behind which we were hidden ( " Molodyets , Pyotr ! Molodyets ! " ) . Venykov had a pear-shaped body on the top of which there was a bald head ( with a wart , like a miniature knob , on his forehead . ) His eyes were tired-red cracks were rushing towards turquoise irises . Behind the smell-screen of sweat , onion and vodka , I could still discern the oily odor of my toys . Venykov had a bath and shaved , but wore the same shirt as before ( a white shirt with a pear-pattern , including leaves on the stalks ) . We had breakfast-Venykov enthusiastically ate away at a heap of bananas ( Mother informing me , by a weighty glance , that bananas are not to be touched , except by Venykov ) , entirely ignoring the boiled eggs and sausage . " It 's hard to come across bananas in Leningrad , " my father translated Venykov 's banana-peeling remark . After the breakfast , Venykov opened one of his ( two ) suitcases and pulled out , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already had dozens on a remote shelf ) . Then he put a bottle ( Stolychnaya ) , wrapped in a sheet of Literaturnaya Gazeta , into my father 's hands . As my father was peeling the bottle , Venykov was dismantling matyoshky ( each of them bearing several smaller ones within , the ultimate one as small as my pinkie ) and was putting them on the table . The table was finally covered with an army of matyoshky , echoing each other , all facing different directions , as if blind . " Nuh ! " Venykov said , touching the head of the largest matyoshka : " Nuh ! " That night we all watched Brigadoon on TV ( Venykov mumbling : " Duraky ! " ) Despite my father 's insistence , he went to sleep in his car-a Volga resembling a gigantic black cockroach , parked in front of our apartment-building . " Why does n't he sleep here ? " I asked . " He feels uncomfortable in a foreign country , " Father said . " He 's afraid of being treated as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more or less , convinced that my father was a spy , and I somehow learned to live with it . I could still catch a shadow passing over his face-a shadow of something that he had been doing and nobody was supposed to know about . He was still making phone calls in Russian , and the film multiplied . Venykov delivered it to him an envelope , and he locked it in the lower drawer of his desk . The conversations they had in Russian , behind the bedroom door , or walking ahead of my mother and me , never sounded like conversations-rather like lectures or briefings . I could n't , however , make myself believe that Venykov was a spy-not when I saw him peeling a banana ( his gaze following the descent of the peel ) or devouring a baklava , or humming with Julie Andrews and making his hand dance with the rhythm , while watching The Sound of Music . I figured that he could be a benign cover or just a naive courier.24 The Venykov weeks passed uneventfully : he was playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the score ? " Father : " One thirty one-one twenty seven . " ) ; visiting the mountains around Sarajevo ; buying cheap Italian jeans from smugglers for his girls . ( A smuggler to his accomplice : " Get me size thirty for Brezhnev ! " ) ; going to movies25 ( You Only Live Twice , From Russia with Love , True Stories VI ) ; talking to my father behind the closed doors . We 'd watch his Volga , before going to sleep , seeing flashes of flesh , as he was putting on his crimson pajamas . Near the end of the third week , at the end of the day that included a movie ( Arabian Nights ) , a dinner ( Bosnian cuisine ) and plenty of delectable Turkish coffee , Venykov agreed to sleep in my room . Lying between my parents ( my sister in her crib ) , I could hear the hum of Venykov 's snoring , occasionally interrupted by the smacking of his lips . Mother : " He 's not going to stay forever , is he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . His wife and children are there . " Me : " Why ca n't they come here ? " Father : " They just ca n't . " The following day , Venykov packed up before any of us got up ( although my sister bawled pitilessly , alarming us , I suppose ) , had a quick breakfast with us , then kissed my forehead , shook his index finger with my sister , hugged my mother and father ( slapping his back dramatically ) , turned on the cockroach-car and drove back to Leningrad . " He 's home , " announced my father two days later , after a brief phone conversation . In my room , Venykov left the scent of his newly purchased aftershave ( Pitralon ) , and a crumpled brown sock under my bed . In October 1977 , my father was arrested.26 There were no screeching cars in the middle of the night , no marble-faced men in long leather coats , no terrified , shivering neighbors too scared to look through the peephole , no breaking doors-not even loud fist-banging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He hung up the phone and said to my mother : " They want me about some traffic violation . It must be a misunderstanding . I 'll be back shortly . " He put tennis shoes ( Puma ) on his bare feet and was gone . He did n't come back home that sleepless night or the day after . My mother was tirelessly making frantic phone calls , none of which lasted more than one or two minutes , for nobody wanted to talk to her . Her dread was increasing , and she was trying to repress it ( soundlessly sobbing ) , while Hanna moaned all the time ( refusing to eat her liquid foods ) . My entertaining the idea that Father was a spy had never been much more than a way to embellish my vacant childhood , but with father 's arrest it suddenly became palpable . My spine tingled with pride in my ability to sense his spyness , while , at the same time , I was scared , beginning to realize that we were up against something beyond my feeble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion beyond my control . I constantly felt an urge to hide under the bed or in the closet , but all I could do was watch my mother swing ( with ululating Hanna in her arms ) back and forth , like a metronome . Photograph The House of the Sorges , outside Baku , Azerbaijan , where Richard was born , after thirty-seven hours of hard labor . Photograph Sorge in September 1941 , just before his arrest , somewhere in Japan . Photograph Richard at the age of eight with his grandfather , Adolph Sorge . Grandpa Adolph told Sorge , all throughout his childhood , stories about Marx poring over Shakespeare ( in English ) and the Greek tragedies ( in Greek ) ; about Marx and Engels playing tennis ( Marx always losing ) , as the mesmerized officials of the First International watched them , moving their heads " left-right , left-right , like a clock pendulum . " Photograph Sorge was not too proud of his early theoretical work : " I am convinced that my handling of these difficult theoretical questions was cumbersome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every last copy . " <p> Four days after my father 's vanishing , Slobodan came . He rang the bell patiently , while my mother was alternately looking through the peephole and at me , deliberating whether to open the door . " I 'm a friend , " Slobodan announced . My mother opened the door , but kept it chained . " Madam , " he said and showed her the inside of his wallet . " I 'm Inspector27 Slobodan . " " State Security , " my mother mumbled . " No need to behave like a hysterical woman , " he said . " I 'm here to help . " Mother unchained the door and let him in . He went straight to the dining room , without taking his shoes off , sat down , wiped his thick glasses and vast forehead with a handkerchief , while Mother and I watched him , benumbed . " I want you to know , madam , that we know everything.28 We have watched , we have listened , and we know , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have no hard feelings about you , we presume that you knew nothing about your husband 's activities . Had you known , you would have informed us , am I right ? Feel free to interrupt me . I can just feel that that pretty mouth of yours wants to start clattering . Cute children , madam . Are they yours ? Just joking-they look exactly like you . What 's the little girl 's name ? She 'll be an attractive woman , I 'll tell you . Feel free to interrupt me . You should n't feel that way about me , madam , I 'm a nice person . I love this country , you know , I think that we have something here , something like no other place in the world and I can tell you that there are plenty of people that think that way . We do n't want this country , what our fathers bled for , to be defiled-it belongs to us and we want to keep it . And if you do n't like it-well , you 're welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wherever the hell you want . Do n't you agree with me ? Tell me , do n't you think the same way ? " My mother said : " Comrade Slobodan , I want you to leave this very moment ! " " I 'll be glad to do so , but not before I take care of several wee things . I need a nice photograph of your husband , for the papers . No ? Well , I 'll take the liberty of looking for this and that . You may watch-lest I be tempted to take something for myself . " My mother retched several times , then put Hanna into the crib and hurried to the bathroom . I heard her vomiting , as if coughing . " Women , always vomiting . Stay away from women , little boy , that 's my advice . So , tell me about your father . Do you like your daddy ? I suppose you do . When I was a boy , I always had a place where I would hide precious little things , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a place like that ? Does your father have a place like that ? Would you show me ? " My mother walked back in . " I was just asking your boy , madam , what does he want to be in his life : What do you want to be , young man ? " " A journalist , " I said . " Smart , very smart . You 're going to get very far , my boy . Madam , if you 'd show me where does your husband keep his private stuff , I 'd be thankful beyond words . No ? Well , then I 'll just look around , if you do n't mind . " He got up and paced around the dining room , pulled out a couple of books from the shelf , flipped through them detachedly , and put them back . He turned towards us , smiled , said : " Pardon me , " and slipped into the bedroom . Mother and I heard noises coming from the bedroom : thumping of suitcases , a screech of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ din of sundry things being thrown on the floor . Mother held my hand , squeezing it-her hand moist and faint . Slobodan walked out with a suitcase , shoving something into his pocket . He produced a little box ( with a painted bee landing on a flower ) out of his hand and said : " Condoms , my boy . Had your father had this on , you would have rotted , stuck in a sewage pipe , years ago . " My mother plucked the box out of his hand and said : " Get out ! " " If you wish to talk to me , feel free to call me . My boss always says that love has political limits.30 Please , call me . " He wrote the phone number on the wall by the front door : 71-782 , then opened the door and walked out . Before my mother closed the door , he shouted in the echoing hall : " We should get together sometime , now that you 're alone . " Mother reluctantly opened the bedroom door : a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like bowed swan heads ) ; the Sputnik glass shattered , pens and pencils scattered around , like corpses . On the bed , there were two symmetrical foot-shaped dents , and mounted ripples on the bedspread around them . After a month or so , Hanna and I went with our mother to visit Father in jail . The visiting room looked like a decrepit hotel hall , with stained and torn sofas and armchairs sorted into separate throngs . Father came followed by a guard31 in a wan blue uniform ( the rim of his cap touching the top of his eyebrows ) . Mother immediately burst into tears and hugged Father . He sat down between Hanna ( " Tata ! Tata ! " ) and me , putting his arms around us ( thin , bloody wristlets ) . The tip of his left eyetooth was broken and under his left ear , at the root of the jaw , there was a huge bruise , like a shadow of the ear . " I 've done nothing wrong , " he said . " Shut your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they torture32 you ? " Mother asked . " A slap or two . " " Shut your fucking mouth ! " " How 's your school ? " Father asked me . " Fine . " " Any problems ? " " No . " " Good " " He got the best grade in the class33 for the history test , " Mother said . " Good , " he said . " Good . " " What do they want from you ? " Mother asked . " They 're interrogating me . They want me to sign a statement . " 34 " Shut your big fucking mouth ! This is the last time I 'm telling you . " Father was sentenced , after a brief ( closed-to-the-public ) trial , to three years of hard labor and was shipped off to the Zenica prison on January 7 , 1978 . There was footage shown on TV of my father ( and four obscure men ) in the courtroom handcuffed , as the voice-over spoke about " disseminating foreign propaganda , " about " the internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his vision , " about " protecting what our fathers bled for . " " We have seen it before , " the voice said . " And we 'll see it again : dissembling intellectuals , spreading dissent like a lethal germ . But this is what we have to tell them : Stay away from the clear stream of our progress or we 'll crush you like snails ! " 35 The years of Father 's imprisonment passed uneventfully : my sister was growing , learning to speak , learning to be sad : my mother became reticent ; and I was going through all those adolescent things : deepening of the voice , rebelling , reading ( The Stranger , The Trial , The Metamorphosis ) ; falling in love ( a Nina , until her father forbade her seeing me ) . But I participated in all this half-heartedly , as if it were all happening to someone else and I were watching it with languid amazement . No one was visiting us and we were going nowhere . Only Slobodan would call once in a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperate men , my boy , and your mother needs all the support she can get . " ) Once a month , we 'd go to see Father . We 'd sit on the bench in the prison yard , even in the winter , exchanging petty information about our walled-off lives , too aware of the gaze of the remote guards and the sharpshooter in the tower booth . In the spring of 1979 , Mother and Father sat at the bench , for two hours , mainly mute , while I was catching stray butterflies for Hanna , and morose prisoners , staring at each other 's napes , revolved around a guard ( chanting : " Left-right ! Leftright ! " ) . When we came back home ( after a two-hour ride in a bus full of drunken , vomiting soldiers ) , Mother burst into tears while unbuttoning her ( black ) shirt , sat on the chair and wept for hours , ignoring my repeated questions , pushing me away with tearful hands . In September 1979 , I wrote my first poem , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The poem was entitled " The Loneliest Man in the World , " it was about Sorge and it was more vicarious self-pitying than anything else . I 'm translating it ( in fact , only the first of ten tedious stanzas ) from memory , for I annihilated the notebook ( with other , much less memorable , poems ) at the peak of my campaign of self-loathing and destruction37 ( which also included shaving every single hair on my body ) in my late teens : Tokyo is breathing and I am not , The curtain of rain glued to my face . I do n't live a life , I live a plot , Having two selves in one place , etc . I wanted to show it to my father , next time we went to visit him , but he was ill and he only wanted to know about the Afghanistan events38 ( political prisoners could not watch news ) . This time we met him in a miasmic room , with a small window looking at the women 's prison . He was escorted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and who would help him get up or walk . ( " You can put me back on the cross now , Barabbas . " ) The prison uniform was dangling from his now-scrawny shoulders . " I shrunk , " he said . In January 1980 , Father was released from prison , diagnosed with brain cancer , curled into an old man , with most of his teeth missing . He could wear my clothes , and the wedding ring was sliding down his finger-he took it off . We rearranged our place and put the TV in the bedroom , Father taking hold of the remote for the rest of his life . He 'd watch TV ( mainly news ) all day , sucking a banana , occasionally passing out and then waking up from listless dreams . On his good days , he 'd be drinking strong-scented tea39 and tell us stories about his U.S.S.R. journeys : about Ukrainian weddings , everybody dancing kolomiyka like there 's no tomorrow ; about nuclear submarines that could stay underwater for years ( crews going blind ) ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far as you could see and beyond . Every day , he was getting smaller and smaller , as if flesh was being squeezed out of him like toothpaste . On May 4 , Comrade Tito died . He had been ailing for a long time and they had had to amputate his leg . We were , for days , repeatedly shown footage of ( monopedic ) Comrade Tito smiling , surrounded by glowing doctors ( happier than anyone that he was alive ) , a wrinkleless sheet covering his retained leg . Sirens begun wailing at 15:04 . I looked through the window and saw everything still : people stood motionless on the street , cars were paralyzed , as if someone had stopped the film in the projector . On the black TV screen white letters emitted : " Comrade Tito has passed away " -no voice-over , no images shown . Sirens stopped wailing , I looked at the street and everybody and everything was gone , as if the ground had gaped open and swallowed it all.0 " I suppose this is the Judgment Day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

It seems that the Rote KapeIle network initially sent the information that German forces were going to attack the Soviet Union . Since the RibbentropMolotov pact was considered to be valid and the source of the information was unclear , Moscow virtually ignored it . But when Sorge sent the confirmation from Tokyo , the information was presented to the great Stalin himself . He , however , disregarded it and decided to trust Hitler and the RibbentropMolotov pact . Sorge 's report from Tokyo on German intentions was filed under the heading " Doubtful and Misleading Information . " Footnote 2 . Sorge flew from Berlin to Yokohama on Junker 's first commercial flight from Germany to Japan , with brief stops in New York and Vancouver . Beside the log of Flight 1995 , kept in the Museum of German Aviation in Frankfurt , there are no records of this historical endeavor . There is no list of passengers , but it is almost certain that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were cosmopolitan , and the flight was tumultuous ( " Winds over the Pacific were just horrid ! " ) ; that something was wrong with the heating system , so the passengers were freezing even with miraculously retrieved fur hats and leather gloves ; that no one slept on the flight ; that the food was edible , but for some reason there was no water so they all drank champagne ( courtesy of Junker ) ; that the plane almost went down in the middle of the night , somewhere over the Pacific ; that first men , then women , disgorged themselves all over the aircraft and the vomit froze on the floor ; that Sorge briefly befriended a certain Mary Kinzie , an American poetess , which did not go unnoticed by idle New York gossip-scribes . On September 9 , 1933 , in the early afternoon , Sorge and his shadowy co-passengers arrived at the Yokohama airport , reeking of vomit , emptied of champagne and lobster , with particles of undigested food thawing on the soles of their shoes . Some of them were proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy to be alive . Footnote 3 . In the early sixties , in the de-Stalinized Soviet Union , the campaign of Sorge 's glorification was set on course and a number of books that contained Sorge 's pictures and previously unrevealed documents from Soviet archives were published . Most of the books were embellished ( if not embroidered ) with , so to speak , fictitious additions . At the same time , a street in Moscow and a tanker were named after Sorge . In the spring of 1965 , the Soviet authorities issued a postage stamp , at a value of four kopecks , in his honor . The commemorative stamp showed Sorge full-face on a scarlet background together with a reproduction of the medal of the Hero of the Soviet Union . 4 .

Little was left of his charm of the romantic idealist , of the cosmopolitan writer whom I had fallen for on Junker 's flight . Nevertheless , he was still extraordinarily good-looking : his cold blue eyes , surrounded with circular darkness , had retained his capacity for vicious self-mockery . He said : My personality is split between a man who hates himself and a man whom I hate . " His hair was still potently black , but his cheekbones and sullen mouth were tired .

Sorge was looking forward to meeting General Berzin , but General Berzin was gone and was replaced by General Semyon Petrovich Uritsky , who was arrested and shot as a Japanese spy in November 1937. 6 . Mother : Nina Kobelev , a conventional Russian beauty ( big eyes , bony pink cheeks , rotund nose , small mouth with thick lips , cobwebby mustacheshadow , long silky hair , et cetera ) , the daughter of Wilhelm 's landlord in Baku . Sorge was born on October 4 , 1895 , after thirty-seven hours of hard labor . Let us note an obvious thing : Germany was his Fatherland , Russia was his Motherland . Footnote 7 . Having agreed to write the full confession , Sorge demanded a ( black-andgreen ) Pelikan fountain pen and a hard-covered notebook with blank sheets . Yoshikawa himself delivered the writing devices . Sorge thanked him and said , in poor Japanese : " Honourable Procurator , this fountain pen is a poisonous fountain pen . " Yoshikawa replied : " Honourable Spy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both laughed . 8 . Sorge never disguised himself , but changed names often . He bragged to Max Klausen that he had more names than women ( " And that is a lot , Max ! " ) He was known as I. K. Sorge , R. Sonter ( Moscow 1924-28 ) ; Johann , Sebastian ( Sweden , 1928 ) ; Christopher , Christian ( England , 1929 ) ; Johnson , Jim , Gimon , Marlowe ( Shanghai , 1930-32 ) ; Richard Sorge ( Tokyo , 1933-44 ) ; and there were many other , unknown , evanescent names . Footnote 9 . Sorge 's activities were much less adventurous than an avid reader would hope . In his written confession , Max Klausen , referring to years 1933-39 , says : " Six dangerous years passed uneventfully , " pointing towards the routine of everyday spying . Sorge 's spying meant patiently collecting diverse , and sometimes ostensibly trite , information : gossip about the Anti-Comintern Pact negotiations ; a rumor about the cabinet changes ; the essence of a drunken soldier 's swaggering about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with someone else 's wife-useful information for the future Index ; air of insurgent desires of young army officers , brought from afar by Miyagi ; chitchat among foreign journalists ; a careless remark of the German ambassador about " everybody being crazy in Berlin about the Russia attack . " In 1936 , however , Sorge obtained a position as the unofficial secretary to the German military attache , Colonel Ott ( " an honest , pleasant , gullible man , with oily military hair , and a thousand and one WW I stories " ) and in 1939 he became the Footnote German embassy press attache . This position enabled him to access documents that were considered confidential , if not top-secret . Only occasionally he would photograph the document , as in the case of the draft of the preliminary document for the Anti-Comintern Pact . Mostly , there was no need for surreptitiousness , for he would take any desired document to his improvised office ( excoffee-kitchen , still reeking of beer from the party celebrating the anniversary of the Hitler ascension ) where he would photograph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In his article in Literaturnaya Gazeta ( January 20 , 1965 ) , entitled " The Man Who Never Knew Enough , " Victor Venykov aptly notes : " A spy is above all a man of politics , who must be able to grasp , analyze and connect in his mind events which seemingly have no connection . He must have the breadth of thought of a historian , the meticulous powers of observation , the spirit and mind of Tolstoy . Espionage is a continuous and demanding labor and the spy forms himself in that process . Least of all was Sorge like those secret agents whom certain Western authors have created . He did not force open safes in order to steal documents : the documents were shown to him by their very owners . He did not fire his pistol to penetrate the places which he had to penetrate : Footnote the doors were graciously opened to him by the guardians of the secret . He did not have to kill . But he was murdered by the brutal machinery . " 10 . In October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hanako , a geisha with mild socialist inclinations . ( " Like many other women I used to read leftwing novels . " ) She did n't mind Sorge 's relentless promiscuity . ( " It is only natural , is n't it , for a famous man to have several mistresses . " ) After Sorge 's execution , Hanako-san patiently pestered the stern prison authorities to allow her to recover Sorge 's body . The ascetic coffin was retrieved from the part of the Sugamo prison cemetery that was reserved for nameless vagrants . Decomposition was rather advanced , and only a large skeleton remained . The large skull ( she kissed his ex-forehead ) and the bones were those of a foreigner ; and there were clear marks of damage to the bones-the eternal result of Sorge 's war wounds . Hanako recognized the teeth ( and imagined a smile ) from their gold filling ( from which , in 1946 , she had a ring made ) . She had the coffin removed to the quiet Tama graveyard , just outside Tokyo . " The Society for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised funds for Sorge 's gravestone , upon which the inscription , in English and Japanese , reads : " Here sleeps a brave stranger who devoted his life to opposing war , and to the struggle for the piece sic ! of the world . " In the early summer of 1965 , Hanako-san was invited to visit the Soviet Union . At the Black Sea ( " This sea is not as black as our sea " -a polite chuckle from the escorting throng followed ) resort of Yalta , Hanako-san saw a performance of Press Attache in Tokyo , a play dealing with Sorge 's life in Tokyo , in which she was rendered by a certain Yekaterina Maximovna . Footnote 11 . Sorge worked for the Fourth Bureau of the Red Army Intelligence , which none of the members of his ring ( Klausen , Voukelitch , Ozaki , Miyagi ) knewthey all referred to " the Moscow center " and were happy to work for peace in the world . Jan Karlovich Berzin ( real name : Peter Kyuzis ) was the all-seeing head of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peasants , born in Madona , 1890 . At the age of nineteen he was arrested by the Tsarist police for involvement in an assassination plot ( a plan to throw a hand grenade at the chief of the Okhrana in the Bolshoi had failed ) , was sentenced to death and then pardoned because of his youth . He spent some time in prison , but surfaced again in 1917 as a member of the Petrograd Bolshevik Party and charged at the Winter Palace . He was the Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs in Soviet Latvia in the spring of 1919 , when the military success of the White armies led him to Footnote take over the command of the Latvian Rifle Division . His first act of command was shooting the previous commander ( name lost ) with his Luger-having accused , tried , sentenced him for " revolutionary feebleness " in front of the petrified Rifle Division-right through his left eye ( the unfortunate previous commander 's brain spurting on the numb political commissar , who later committed suicide ) . The legend of this execution followed Berzin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bureau and reached Sorge the day before he was to meet him . Berzin and Sorge quickly became friends ( Sorge : " I respected his blood-red facial scars and his bright gray hair . " ) They used nicknames when addressing each other : Berzin was Stark , Sorge was Ika . In 1935 , Berzin was arrested and strangled with piano wire ( an unusual and rather creative execution ) as a German spy . It seems that Sorge never found out about Berzin 's political death . He never mentioned him , however , after his last visit to Moscow in 1935 . Sorge never admitted working for the Red Army , and the Soviet Union maintained , after his arrest , that he had worked for the Comintern , which was supposedly beyond the jurisdiction of the Soviet authorities . Footnote 12 . The encoded messages carrying reports on Sorge 's ( and his co-spies ' ) activities were sent regularly , although at different , previously-agreed-upon times . Max Klausen was the telegraphist ( and only the telegraphist ) . Sorge trusted his blunt ignorance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The radio operated from Voukelitch 's home in the Bunka apartment-complex , across from a rather malodorous canal , named Ochanomizu- " honourable tea-water " ; or from Klausen 's apartment , in the Akasaka district , with the windows perennially behind curtains of drying bedsheets and underwear ; or , almost never , from Sorge 's place ( No. 30 Nagasaka-cho ) in Azabu , an affluent part of the city . The book used for coding messages was an edition of The Complete Shakespeare , probably one of the Cambridge editions from the late twenties . Max Klausen : " We would send the number of the play in the book ( we called it the Book ) , then the number of the act , then the number of the scene upon which the scramble-code would be based . I had never read Shakespeare and found it quite boring , but Sorge was able to quote lengthy passages from any play . I remember once we used a passage , I forgot from which play , where there was a phrase " God 's spies . " Sorge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that passage ) and then said : We 're God 's spies , except there 's no God , " and we got a kick out of it and laughed like mad . " The passage that Klausen alludes to is from The History of King Lear and goes as follows : Footnote . . so we 'll live , And pray , and sing , and tell old tales , and laugh At gilded butterflies , and hear poor rogues Talk of court news , and we 'll talk with them too , Who loses and who wins , who 's in , who 's out , And take upon 's the mystery of things As if we were God 's spies . Footnote 13 . At the outset of Sorge 's mission to Japan , Berzin told him : " The only thing you should trust and rely upon is the omnipresence of surveillance . There 'll be eyes everywhere , and nowhere . " Sorge was all too aware of being watched : even on the Junker flight , he felt a gaze adhered to his body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once in Japan , the following things made Sorge aware of the surveillance : a ) he was being watched by Aritomi Mitsukado , a reporter for Jiji Shimpo , who would somehow always find him in any bar or at any party and then ask a transparent question like : " Do you think this tyranny will last forever ? " ( Sorge : " What tyranny ? " ) ; b ) his maid and laundryman were frequently questioned and tortured by the police ; Footnote c ) a woman he slept with ( name lost ) got up in the middle of the night and went through his pockets , finding nothing ; d ) in bars and restaurants , even at the Imperial Hotel , he was constantly monitored by plainclothesmen of the Thought Police ( sticking out of the careless crowd by being too focused on him ) ; e ) his house was searched and his suitcases examined , during his absences ; f ) most of all , it was a sense that he developed , a sense that someone 's gaze was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sorge : " When you know that you 're being watched , you assume a role and play it , even when you sleep-even when you dream . Most of my life I played Richard Sorge , and I was someone else , somewhere else . The ubiquitous surveillance makes everything look different-you see things through someone else 's eyes . Everything is more present-more real-because you see nothing alone . " Footnote 14 . Sorge 's group maintained radio-contact mainly with Vladivostok ( code name : " Wittenberg " ) and , seldom , Moscow ( code name : " Munich " ) . 15 . In 1924 , upon a decoy invitation from the Moscow Marx-Engels Research Institute , led by the illustrious scholar Chichikov , Sorge left Germany Footnote for good and went to Moscow . Having spent some weeks in different ( desolate , apart from German roaches ) apartments , Sorge finally settled in the Lux Hotel , room 101 . The Lux was the place where all foreign comrades working for the Comintern lived . Indeed , a day after he took off his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with misty fingerprints all over ) of vodka , and unpacked his two suitcases ( one of which was full of books : Das Kapital , Doctor Faustus , Seven Sweet Little Girls , et cetera ) , he was visited by comrades Pyatnitski , Kuusinen , Klopstock . The three Comintern activists were infamous for never leaving the proximity of each other ( " They were called the Three Kings , " but then Klopstock disappeared in the late thirties , I think . " ) They talked to him all night long , becoming friends along the way , and effortlessly recruited him for the Comintern Intelligence Division . ( Pyatnitski : " The Comintern is not a party but a world organization of national Communist parties . It toils for world Communism , for the incorporation of the whole world into a single Communist society . " Footnote Kuusinen : " That is , it seeks to do away with private ownership of the means of production , with class exploitation and oppression , with racial tyranny , and to unite nations in accordance with a single master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Comintern is the brains directing activities of the sections as they endeavor to achieve a goal for this stage in the development of world Communism . " All : " Welcome ! " ) In the thirties the Lux Hotel became a virtual detention camp , for foreign comrades were more liable to become foreign spies . The hotel tenants " revolutionary activities were palsied , as they were perennially waiting for the NKVD footsteps to stop before their doors . A car stopping noisily in the middle of the night , in front of the hotel , would have a suicide or two as a consequence . No tenant would let the cleaning personnel into his or her apartment , and after a while cleaning was abandoned altogether . Hence already uncontrollable cockroaches multiplied exponentially . By 1941 , none of the residents from the thirties was left in the hotel , apart from now-gigantic cockroaches and a comrade from Yugoslavia , mad and dying , preserved only due to a careless bureaucratic error . Footnote 16 . Beside German Imperialism ( 1927 ) , a study of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I , and The Accumulation of Capital and Rosa Luxembourg ( 1922 ) , a study of the life and theories of the great German revolutionary , Sorge 's most important work was Marxism and Love ( 1921 ) , a work about human relationships in the context of merciless exploitation . In the Introduction , Sorge writes : " Thus love is not possible in a class society , for every human relationship is a relationship of property , exploitation and ideological subjugation . Love as a concept can be achieved only in a classless society , where a man is a man and a woman is a woman . Just as the decisive intensification of class struggle , exposing the cruelty of capitalism , leads towards the revolution , the intensification of purely sexual relations would expose the inhumanity of individual human relations . The consequent objectified vacuum of inhumanity would simply require a revolutionary action . Love , to sum up , is not what we need now-what we need now is sex ! " Scholars claim that Marxism and Love is more a product of the unfulfilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his teacher at the Kiel University , than a product of studious research . Some , however , tried to show that Marxism and Love ( and some articles , like " Anal Sex and Revolution " from 1923 ) influenced Wilhelm Reich . Sorge himself was not too proud of his early theoretical work : " I am convinced that my handling of these difficult theoretical questions was cumbersome and immature , and I hope that the Nazis burned every last copy . " Footnote 17 . Sorge 's house was what the Japanese in those days called a bunka jutaku , or " an up-to-date residence , " which was , by contemporary European or American standards , rather small . Alphonse Kauders , who visited Sorge in 1939 , described it as " scarcely more than a two story dog-house in a small garden . " In the upstairs room that Sorge used as his study , the untidiness that surrounded him amused his friends ( Kauders : " It was like a Verdun of things . " ) and horrified his housemaid ( " German pig ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books , maps , magazines and papers . Kauders recalls that many of the books were on economics ( notably on the geisha wage system ) , that there were American movie magazines ( obtained from Gimon ) and that there was " some Footnote quite interesting Asian pornography . " There were one or two fine Japanese prints and some expensive pieces of bronze and china . There were photographs of Japanese creek dams and a photograph of Greta Garbo on the thin walls . The room also contained a gramophone , and a pet owl ( fed with local mice and cockroaches ) in a cage . Sorge respected Japanese customs by removing his shoes at the front door , and by wearing velvet slippers on the stairs and in the tiny corridor . He slept in Japanese fashion , on a mattress laid on the tatami , with his head on a small round , hard pillow . Kauders , describing Sorge 's bathroom , remembers that " the fanatically clean Sorge scrubbed himself daily , as if there was no tomorrow , and then , drawing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with scorchingly hot water . " Footnote 18 . Sorge 's grandfather , Adolph Sorge , had served as the secretary for the First International during Marx 's lifetime . Grandpa Adolph told Sorge , throughout his childhood , Marx stories : about Marx reading Shakespeare ( in English ) and the Greek tragedies ( in Greek ) every July ; about Marx and Engels playing tennis ( Marx always losing ) , as the officials of the First International watched them , moving their heads " left-right , left-right , like a clock pendulum " ; about Grandpa Adolph , stopping by Marx 's home and taking him to a bogus meeting , covering Marx 's secret trysts with his ( recently fired ) housemaid ; about Marx 's pathological fear of dentists-Engels or Grandpa having to go with him and hold his hand as the blood was soaking his immortal beard ; about holding , piously , the manuscript of The Communist Manifesto , knowing that it was something that was to change the world forever , " the world that philosophers theretofore only attempted to interpret . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a frequent visitor of the infamous opium houses . In 1932 , in the middle of the siege of Shanghai , in Gong Li 's opium bar , Sorge had a sensation of the physically split personality : Sorge stepped out of his own body and left it to wallow in its opiatic stupor , while he walked among the defenders , with a Germanic nostalgia for trenches , handing out grenades to poorly clad and armed Chinese , not fearing Japanese bullets , hallucinating about " the eye of the ubiquitous sniper , the infinite preciseness of the supreme sharpshooter . " Footnote 20 . Sorge was admitted to the Tokyo branch of the Nazi Party in October 1934 . In his speech , preceding an orgiastic drinking contest , Colonel Ott said : " One can not but feel that our cause will be only strengthened by the energy of Dr. Richard Sorge , our beloved fellow German . There 's no better occasion to use , once again , our Fuhrer 's timeless words : We have hundreds of thousands of the most intelligent sons of peasants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already doing so , and we wish them someday to occupy the leading positions of state and society , along with the rest of our educated strata , and not the members of the alien people . We are determined to thwart and thrust aside this alien people that knew how to insinuate itself and seize all the leading positions for itself , for we want our own people for that position . " I deeply believe that Dr. Richard Sorge 's blood will only enhance the purity of the German blood . Welcome , Richard , welcome ! " 21 . The Thought Police inspectors , with the typical bureaucratic thoroughness , made an inventory of items seized at Sorge 's house upon the arrest . Those Footnote bare objects-the physical tools of espionage-were to form the first grim and material skeleton in the body of proof to be forged against him . They included three cameras ; one copying camera with accessories ; three photo lenses ( one telescopic ) ; developing equipment ; two rolls of film with photographed documents ( the nature of the documents is unclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ containing $1,782 ; sixteen notebooks with details of contacts with agents and notes in an unknown language ; Sorge 's Nazi Party card ( with membership fees paid until 1951 ) and a list of Party members in Japan ; two volumes of The Complete Shakespeare ( no data as to which edition ) ; seven pages of reports and charts in English ; and , lastly and fatally , two pages of a typewritten draft , also in English , of the final message of achievement , to be sent to " Wittenberg " on October 15. 22 . Sorge : " In the summer of 1914 , I visited Sweden on vacation , and returned to Germany by the last boat available . The Austrian Archduke had been assassinated in Sarajevo , and World War I broke out . I volunteered for service immediately , joining the army without reporting to my school or taking the final graduation examination . This period may be described as from the schoolhouse to the slaughterhouse . " " Sorge was sent to the Eastern Front ( Galicia ) . He was befriended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose head was shattered into smithereens before Sorge 's very eyes , a piece of skull bone cutting his face ( a permanent scar remained ) . In July 1915 , Footnote Sorge was wounded by shrapnel in his right leg . In 1916 , a bullet struck him from the back , taking out his bowels . Sorge was transported to a field hospital , conscious , watching with listless amazement his viscera throbbing in his hands . Exhausted surgeons gave him no hope of survival , but patched him up and let him occupy a bed . Sorge 's next-bed neighbor , a Jewish boy , crushed his skull against the bed frame , as Sorge was helplessly writhing in his own pain . In early 1917 , fully and miraculously recovered , Sorge was sent back to the Galician Front , where he became one of the best sharpshooters in his division , specialized in eliminating the enemy snipers . 23 . Sorge was a passionate chess player . He played against Kurt Gerlach ( Sorge : 25-Gerlach : 50 ) ; Pyatnitski , Kuusinen , Klopstock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ; Berzin ( Sorge : 131-Berzin : 127 ) ; Klausen ( Sorge : 1-Klausen : 0 ) ; Ozaki ( Sorge : 50-Ozaki : 49 ) ; Hanako ( Sorge : 111-Hanako : 0 ) ; Ott ( Sorge : 45-Ott : 12 ) ; and he played against himself daily . Footnote 24 . Sorge : " Legitimate and plausible cover is absolutely essential for a spy . I worked as a news reporter and found that the foreign correspondent is conveniently situated for the acquisition of information of various types , but that he 's Footnote closely observed by the police . I believe , however , that the best thing an agent can do is to render himself as an intellectual : a professor , a writer , a scholar . Generally speaking , the intellectual class is made up of men of average or less than average intelligence , and the agent who assumes such a cover would be quite safe from detection by police . Moreover , as an intellectual with extensive scholarly connections ( which he would utilize as sources or transmitters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information they know nothing about , he could ask ostensibly ludicrous questions and develop trust . I think that intellectuals are the pets of the world , digging holes in the backyard of history . They can move around without arousing suspicion . " 25 . In the files of the Frankfurt Police , dating from 1927 , there is a vague and unconfirmed report showing that a Dr. Richard Sorge left for the United States on January 24,1926 , and spent some time in California , working in Hollywood film studios . The only admission , however , made by Sorge of visiting America was on his way to Japan . Herr Alexander Hemon , a researcher at the German Foreign Office Archives , claims that there is " a possibility that Dr. Richard Sorge , said by the police to have been in Frankfurt in 1925 and 1926 , was not the Soviet spy who was working in Tokyo and on mysterious missions abroad , but someone else , of whom we know nothing . " Footnote 26 . On the evening of Tuesday , October 7 , 1941 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Asia Restaurant , in the South Manchurian Railway building . He kept the appointment in vain , devouring sake , absentmindedly flirting with a woman ( " a Mary Kinzie look-alike " ) gorging on escargot at the next table . Miyagi was due to come to Sorge 's house two days later , but failed to appear . On Friday , October 10 , Klausen and Voukelitch called on Sorge , by a prior arrangement , in an atmosphere of mounting disquiet . Voukelitch telephoned Ozaki 's office and received no answer . Klausen : " The air was heavy , and Sorge said gravely-as if our fate was sealed-Neither Joe nor Otto showed up to meet us . They must have been arrested by the police . " " After Voukelitch and Klausen left Sorge 's house and strayed towards their respective fates ( Voukelitch : died of typhus in the prison hospital ; Klausen : scorched in his prison cell by an American bomb during an air raid ) , Sorge could not rest and instead made frantic love to Hanako , who was gentler and smoother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plainclothesman ( name lost ) , with two uniformed , sleepy policeman , knocked politely at Sorge 's door and , receiving no answer ( Sorge and Hanako approaching another climax ) shouted : " We have come to see you about your recent traffic accident . " Sorge appeared at the door in pajamas and slippers and then was , without further interlocution , bundled into an inconspicuously black police car , protesting ( in a whisper , so as not to wake up his neighbors ) that his arrest was illegal . Footnote 27 . The procurator directly responsible for the interrogation of Sorge was Yoshikawa Mitsusada of the Thought Department of the Tokyo District Court Procurator Bureau . Yoshikawa had an extensive knowledge of current political and economic thought , including Marxism . It was rumored that he had been a Marxist himself when he was a student at Tokyo Imperial University . Soon after graduating from the university , he had written a comprehensive study of the geisha wage system . It seems that there was some mutual admiration between the two of them . Yoshikawa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen anyone as great as he was . " After the sentence , at their last meeting , Sorge asked Yoshikawa to be kind to Hanako-san : " She will marry a professor in the end , and have a boring and happy life . Do n't do anything to her . " 28 . Some of Sorge 's information , seemingly petty , was dispatched , by the way of the Fourth Bureau , to the GPU , which used it to build the foundations for what would become the KGB 's Sixth Division of the First Directorate-the infamous Index . The Index was a vast collection of biographical and personal data about everyone who might , even very remotely , be of use at some time or another , to Soviet espionage . The Index files contained information about sexual preferences ( obtained by voyeuristic monitoring or tempting agents ) ; eating ( restaurant bills , et cetera ) and sleeping habits ( calls in the middle of the night , Footnote monitoring , et cetera ) ; about sport-team affiliations ; about reading interests ( subscription lists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories , apparently unrelated , which helped the one in charge of the particular individual to assess what sort of person he or she was to utilize . The information could be used for blackmail , or for assuming the right approach when recruiting , or for plugging damaging information into the public 's mind . Cold War defectors brought numerous stories about the Index and , almost without exception , claimed that the official slogan was " We know everything ! " In pre-computer times , only the Nazi Gestapo had much the same kind of organization , but it was not nearly as detailed nor all-embracing as the Index . There are claims , dating all the way from the sixties , that the United States government agencies ( CIA , or FBI , or both ) are building a computer database , founded on principles similar to the Index 's , but none of those claims has ever been confirmed . 29 . Major General Charles A. Willoughby , MacArthur 's chief of intelligence ( 1941-51 ) , confiscated all the Japanese Sorge files that survived the leveling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which helped uncover many a Communist network back home in the United States of America . In his book Shanghai Conspiracy : The Sorge Spy Ring ( 1952 ) he aptly notes : " Though the work of Dr. Richard Sorge and his companions belongs to history , the methods of their work should serve as a clear warning for today and for the future . They concern not just the intelligence officer but every good citizen . Some of the implications are frightening . One begins to wonder whom one can trust , what innocent-appearing friend may suddenly be discovered as an enemy . " Footnote 30 . In August 1941 , Hanako-san was summoned to the Thought Police headquarters and urged by a man named Nakamura to break off relations with Sorge . ( " They do n't know what loyalty means ! They do n't know the value of the family ! " ) The typically Sorgean , sardonic reaction was to invite Nakamura to dinner-an invitation that was embarrassingly ignored . Footnote 31 . In the Sugamo prison , Sorge was befriended , somewhat surprisingly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had written his confession , Ohashi brought newspapers to Sugamo every day , together with a supply of Sorge 's own tea . Sometimes they 'd drink tea together in Sorge 's cell . ( Sorge : " If I am sentenced to death , Captain Ohashi , I shall become a ghost and haunt you . " ) In October 1944 , after the execution day had been set , Ohashi bought some fruit and sake and gave what he described as a " farewell party " for Sorge . Ohashi begged a farewell gift from Sorge-preferably Sorge 's black Italian shoes with leather soles and silk laces . After Sorge was led to the execution , the polished pair of shoes was found in his cell ( toes facing the wall ) , with folded silk socks inside , and a note for Ohashi : " I shall never forget your kindness during the most difficult time of my eventful life . " 32 . Before getting to Yoshikawa , Sorge went through the obligatory interrogation conducted by lower procurators , which chiefly meant rather routine torture : Sorge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formal Japanese style , for hours , while three procurators struck him repeatedly , stamped their feet on his knees , or twisted his head and arms in a judo hold . On occasion , they 'd bum hair or pierce particularly sensitive points ( nipples , testicles , anus ) on his body . Every once in a while Sorge would just close his eyes and try to ignore the immense pain . The momentary trance would be smashed by a full Footnote fist blow from behind to his ear or the nape of his neck-the pain would be so intense that Sorge vomited uncontrollably . Naturally , he did not sign the confession under the torture . 33 . While in high school , Sorge 's best friend was a Jewish boy named Franz , with whom he shared interest in German history-particularly Barbarossa and Bismarck . The friendship was abruptly broken off , after Franz tried to kiss Ika , over the book about Barbarossa 's incursion , full of pictures of heavily armored German knights on stout armor-skirted horses . 34 . Sorge broke down in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statements by Klausen , Voukelitch , Ozaki and Miyagi were shown to him . Yoshikawa made the following appeal : " What about your obligations as a human being ? Your friends , who have risked their lives and families to work with you , for your cause , have confessed and may hope thereby to secure some mitigation , however slight , of their sentences . Are you going to abandon them to their fate ? Are you going to betray them ? Are you going to be remembered as a typical Western man , caring more about himself than anyone else ? If I were in your place , I 'd confess . " Sorge said : " Honourable Procurator , I have been defeated , for which I congratulate you , " after which he requested the pen ( black-and-green Pelikan ) and paper ( blank-sheet , hard-covered notebook ) . He wrote an autobiographical confession which amounted to some 50,000 words and began with words : " For the first time in my life , I want to tell the truth : I have been a Communist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Japanese nor Soviet public was ever informed about Sorge 's trial and execution . Indeed , there was no official acknowledgment from either of the governments , apart from a brief cable from the German Ambassador ( recently promoted ex-Colonel Ott ) in Tokyo , closing the case as far as Berlin was concerned : " The German journalist Richard Sorge who , as previously reported , had been condemned to death for espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union , was , according to a communication from the Foreign Ministry , hanged on November 7th . " ( Let us note a well-known fact : November 7 , 1944 , was the twenty-seventh anniversary of the October Revolution . ) Footnote 36 . In 1919 , Sorge wrote a poem which began with the line : " Eternally a stranger , fleeing from himself " and read it in the Gerlach 's salon before the audience of leftist university professors , Christiane and Kurt himself . Kurt Gerlach mercilessly mocked Sorge 's poetic instincts : " Fleeing from himselfbah ! Where would you go ? That 's bourgeois gibberish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in history by history-not a self , not an essence hoarded in the center of the metaphysical fluff . Eternally a stranger ' -bah ! " Sorge burned the sheet with his poem and made no literary attempts ( his confession notwithstanding ) for the rest of his life . 37 . After the disastrous courting attempt , driven by a choking desire for Christiane ( " Dear Ika ! I have liked you , even your self-mocking and sardonic wit . But what you did last night is not what a decent woman can bear .... " ) , Footnote Sorge attempted suicide . Lacking courage to end his life with his mind clear , he fueled his death wishes with cheap pear schnapps , while a razor lay , ominously , on the table before him .

Sorge , who perceived that this was the battlefield where the war was to be decided , took great interest in news about the battle . He 'd ask Yoshikawa in the court , whispering , about Stalingrad , while the judge would be talking to his clerk . Footnote Yoshikawa would reply in an undertone , telling him about the general situation ( " They 're keeping their positions , " or " It looks good " ) . The preliminary judge knew what was going on , but did nothing to stop them . When Stalingrad was saved , Ohashi watched Sorge , through the peephole of his cell , dancing , clapping hands , and kissing the walls with joy . 39 . Moments before the execution , the chief chaplain of the Sugamo prison ( accompanied with Yoshikawa and Ohashi ) offered Sorge tea and cake , and said : " Life and death are one and the same thing to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attained by entrusting everything to the mercy of Buddha . " Sorge said : " I thank you , but : no ! " Footnote 40 . Sorge was led into a vaporous , windowless , bare room , with a gallows standing in the center . He was led across the room and placed beneath the gallows , while a noose was affixed around his neck . There was no staircase to climb , no platform to stand on . The trap was in the floor , immediately beneath his feet . <p> 
##1003662 I <p> A blond , blue-eyed child , about three years old , no one will know her exact age , ever , is sitting in the clay of a country road , as if she and the clay are one , as if she is the first human , but she is not . She is dressed in a boy 's shirt , sewn from Osnaburg check , which serves her as a dress . Her face is scabbed . The West Indian sun , even at her young age , has made rivulets underneath her eyes where waters run . She is always hungry . She works the clay into a vessel which will hold nothing . Lizards fly between the tree ferns that stand at the roadside . A man is driving an American Ford , which is black and eating up the sun . He wears a Panama hat with a red band around it . He carries a different brightly colored band for each day of the week . He is pale and the band interrupts his paleness . His head is balding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In his business , appearance is important . He is practicing his Chinese as he negotiates the mountain road , almost washed away by the rains of the night before . His abacus rattles on the seat beside him . With each swerve and bump , and there are many , the beads of the abacus quiver and slide . He is alone . " You should see some of these shopkeepers , my dear , " he tells his wife . " They make this thing sing . " His car is American and he has an American occupation . He is a traveling salesman . He travels into the interior of the island , his car packed with American goods . Many of the shopkeepers are Chinese , but like him , like everyone it seems , are in love with American things . He brings American things into the interior , into the clearing cut from ruinate . Novelties and necessities . Witch hazel . Superman . Band-Aids . Zane Grey . Chili con came . Cap guns . Coke syrup . Fruit cocktail . Camels . Marmalade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mirror make room on the shopkeepers " shelves . The salesman has always wanted a child . His wife says she never has . " Too many pickney in the world already , " she says , then kisses her teeth . His wife is brown-skinned . He is not . He is pale , with pale eyes . The little girl sitting in the road could be his , but the environment of his wife 's vagina is acid . And then there is her brownness . Well . And then he sees her . Sitting filthy and scabbed in the dirt road as he comes around a comer counting to a hundred in Chinese . She is crying . Has he startled her ? He stops the car . He and his wife have been married for twenty years . They no longer sleep next to each other . They sleep American-style , as his wife calls it . She has noticed that married couples in the movies sleep apart . In " Hollywood " beds . She prevails on Mr. Dickens ( a handyman she is considering bringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hollywood " beds from mahogany . The salesman gets out of the car and walks over to the little girl . He asks after her people . She points into the bush . He lifts her up . He uses his linen hanky to wipe off her face . He blots her eye-corners , under her nose . He touches her under her chin . " Lord , what a solemn lickle ting . " He hears her tummy grumble . At the edge of the road there is a narrow path down a steep hillside . The fronds of a coconut tree cast shadows across the scabs on her face . He notices they are rusty . They will need attention . He thinks he has a plan . At the end of the narrow path is a clearing , with some mauger dogs , packed red-dirt yard , and a wattle house set on cement blocks . The doorway , there is no door , yawns into the darkness . He walks around the back , still holding the child , the dogs sniffing at him , licking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blond and blue-eyed , is squatting under a tree . He is afraid to approach any closer , afraid she is engaged in some intimate activity , but soon enough she gets up , wipes her hand on her dress and walks toward him . Yes , this is her little girl , the woman says in a strangely accented voice . And the salesman realizes he 's stumbled on the descendants of a shipload of Germans , sent here as convicts or cheap labor , he ca n't recall which . There are to this day pockets of them in the deep bush . He balances the little girl in one arm , she weighs next to nothing , removes his hat , inclines his balding head toward the blonder woman . She lowers her blue eyes . One eye has a cloud , the start of a cataract from too much sun . He knows what he wants . The woman has other children , sure , too many , she says . He offers twenty American dollars , just like that , counting out the single notes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything , always , and that he loves children and has always wanted one of his own but he and his wife have never been so blessed . The woman says something he does not understand . She points to a small structure at the side of the house . Under a peaked roof is a statue of the Virgin Mary , a dish of water at her feet . On her head is a coronet of lignum vitae . She is rude but painted brightly , like the Virgins at the roadside in Bavaria , carved along routes of trade and plague . Her shawl is colored indigo . " Liebfrau , " the woman repeats . He nods . The Virgin 's shawl is flecked with yellow , against indigo , like the Milky Way against the black of space . The salesman is not Catholic but never mind . He promises the little girl will attend the Convent of the Immaculate Conception at Constant Spring , the very best girls " school on the island . He goes on about their uniforms . Very handsome indeed . Royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue hatbands . He points to the band around his own hat by way of explanation . The royal blue will make his daughter 's eyes bright . This woman could not be more of a wonder to him . She is a stranger in this landscape , this century , she of an indentured status , a petty theft . He wonders at her loneliness . No company but the Virgin Mother . The woman extends her hand for the money , puts it in the side pocket of her dress . She strokes the head of her daughter , still in the salesman 's arms . " She can talk ? " " Jah , no mus ' ? " A squall comes from inside the darkness of the house , and the woman turns , her dress becoming damp . " Well , goodbye then , " the salesman says . She turns back . She opens her dress and presses a nipple , dripping , into the mouth of her little girl . " Bye , bye , " she says . And she is gone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl makes no fuss , not even a whimper , as he carries her away , and he is suddenly afraid he has purchased damaged goods . What if she 's foolish ? It will be difficult enough to convince his brown-skinned wife to bring a white-skinned child into the house . If she is fool-fool God help him . Back at the car he tucks her into the front seat , takes his penknife and opens a small tin of fruit cocktail . He points to the picture on the label , the glamorous maraschino cherry . " Wait till you taste this , darlin ' . It come all the way from America . " Does she have the least sense of what America is ? He wipes away the milk at the corners of her mouth . He takes a spoon from the glove compartment . " You can feed yourself ? " She says nothing , so he begins to spoon the fruit cocktail into her . Immediately she brightens and opens her mouth wide , tilting her head back like a little bird . In no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat too fast , sweetheart . Do n't want to get carsick . " " Nein , nein , " she says with a voice that 's almost a growl . She closes her eyes against the sun flooding the car . " Never mind , " he says , " we 'll be off soon . " He wraps the spoon and empty fruit-cocktail tin into a sheet of the Gleaner , putting the package on the floor of the back seat . Next time he will pour some condensed milk into the tinned fruit , making it even sweeter . There 's a big American woman who runs a restaurant outside Milk River . She caters to the tourists who come to take the famously radioactive waters . And to look at the crocodiles . She also lets rooms . She will let him a room for the night . In turn he will give her the American news she craves . She says she once worked in the movies . He does n't know if he believes her . He puts the car in gear and drives away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this how women feel ? he wonders , as he glances at the little girl , now fast asleep . What has he done ? She is his treasure , his newfound thing , and he never even asked her name . What will you call this child ? the priest will ask . Now she is yours . He must have her baptized . Catholic or Anglican , he will decide . He will have to bathe her . He will ask the American woman to help him . He will take a bathroom at the mineral spring and dip her into the famous waters , into the " healing stream , " like the old song says . He will baptize her himself . The activity of the spring , of world renown , will mend her skin . The scabs on her face are crusted over and there are more on her arms and legs . She might well have scurvy , even in the midst of a citrus grove . But the waters are famous . As he drives he alternates between making plans and imagining his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken leave of your senses , busha . She calls him busha when she 's angry and wants him to stand back . No , busha . Is who tell you we have room fi pickney ? He will say he had no choice . Was he to leave this little girl in the middle of a country road covered with dirt and sores and hungry ? Tell me , busha , tell me jus " one ting : Is how many pickney you see this way on your travels , eh ? Is why you do n't bring one home sooner ? Tell me that . Everybody wants a child that favors them , that 's all . She will kiss her teeth . If she will let him have his adoption , he will say , she can have the other side of the house for her and Mr. Dickens . It will be simple . Once he plays that card there will be no going back . They will split the house down the middle . That will be that . Like is drawn to like . Fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantages to being a traveling salesman in this place . He learns the island by heart . Highland and flood plain , sinkhole and plateau . Anywhere a shopkeeper might toss up , fix some shelves inside a zinc-roofed shed , open shop . He respects the relentlessness of shopkeepers . They will nest anywhere . You can be in the deepest bush and come upon a tin sign advertising Nescafe , and find a group of people gathered as if the shed were a town hall , which it well might be . Everything is commerce , he can not live without it . On the road sometimes he is taken by what is around him . He is distracted by gorges , ravines possessed of an uncanny green . Anything could dwell there . If he looks closer he will enter the island 's memory , the petroglyphs of a disappeared people . The birdmen left by the Arawak . Once he took a picnic lunch of cassava cake and fried fish and ginger beer into the burial cave at White Marl , and left a piece of cassava @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gazes at the remains of things . Stone fences , fallen , moss-covered , which might mark a boundary in Somerset . Ruined windmills . A circular ditch where a coffle marked time on a treadmill . As steady as an orbit . A salesman is free , he tells himself . He makes his own hours , comes and goes as he pleases . People look forward to his arrival , and not just for the goods he carries . He is part troubadour . If he 's been to the movies in town he will recount the plot for a crowd , describe the beauty of the stars , the screen washed in color . These people temper his loneliness . But now , now . Now he thinks he 'll never be lonely again . II The Bath is located on the west bank of Milk River , just south of where the Rio Bronte , much tamer than its name , branches off . The waters of the Bath rise through the karst , the heart of stone . The ultimate source of the Bath is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea . The relationship with the sea is suggested everywhere ; the limestone that composes more of the land than any other substance is nothing but the skeletons of marine creatures . " From the sea we come , to the sea we shall return . " His nursemaid used to chant this as he lay in his pram on King 's Parade . The water of the Bath is a steady temperature of 91 degrees Fahrenheit ( 33 degrees Centigrade ) . The energy of the water is radiant , fiftyfive times more active than Baden-Baden , fifty times more active than Vichy . Such is the activity that bathers are advised not to remain immersed for more than fifteen minutes a day . In the main building the bather may read testimonials to the healing faculties of the waters . These date to 1794 when the first bathrooms were opened . Lord Salisbury was cured of lowness of spirit Hamlet , his slave , escaped depraved apprehensions May 1797 , Anno Domini Mrs. Home was cured of the hysteria and loss of spleen December 1802 , Anno Domini @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anno Domini Septimus Hart , Esq. , banished his dread July 1835 , Anno Domini The Hon. Catherine Dillon was cured of a mystery February 1900 , Anno Domini The waters bore magical properties . Indeed some thought the power of the Lord was in them . The salesman 's car glides into the gravel parking lot of the Little Hut , the American woman 's restaurant . She named it after a movie she made with Ava Gardner and Stewart Granger . " A movie she made " sounds grandiose ; she picked up after Miss Gardner , stood in for her during long shots . She hears the car way back in the kitchen of the restaurant , where she 's supervising Hamlet VII in the preparation of dinner . Tonight , pepper-pot soup to start , followed by curried turtle , rice and peas , a Bombay mango cut in half and filled with vanilla ice cream . The American woman , her head crowned with a thick black braid , comes out of the doorway onto the verandah which runs around the Little Hut , and walks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what have we got here ? " She points to the passenger seat in front . " What are you ? A kidnapper or something ? " She 's wearing a khaki shirt with red-and-black epaulets , the tails knotted at her midsection , and khaki shorts . The kitchen steam has made her clothes limp , and sweat stains bloom on her back and under her arms . Her feet are bare . She wears a silver bangle around one ankle . " Gone native " is one of her favorite ways of describing herself , whether it means bare feet , a remnant of chain , or swimming in Milk River alongside the crocodiles . Still she depends on the salesman to bring her news of home . " I 've got your magazines , your Jets , " the salesman says , ignoring her somewhat bumptious remark . It was late afternoon by now . A quick negotiation about a room for the night and then he would take his little sleepyhead , who has not stirred , to be bathed . He has great faith in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American woman about a room . " There 's only one available right now , " she tells him . " I 've been overrun . The room is located behind the restaurant next to the room where Hamlet VII sleeps . The salesman , she remembers his name is Harold ( he was called " Prince Hal " at school , he told her ) , hers is Rosalind , is not crazy about sleeping in what he considers servants " quarters , and tells her so . " My daughter , " he begins . Rosalind interrupts him . " Look , this is all I have right now . You may as well take it . " He 's silent . " It 's clean and spacious , " she tells him , " lots of room for you , and for her . " She nods in the direction of the little girl . She ca n't help but be curious , aware from his earlier visits that he said he had no children , that his wife had turned her back on him , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an import firm with being a pirate on the Spanish Main , right down to the ribbon on his hat and his galleon of a car . " Footloose and fancy-free , " was how he described himself to her , but Rosalind did n't buy it . He seemed like a remnant to her . So many of them did . There was something behind the thickness of green , in the crevices of bone ; she wore a sign of it on her ankle . " Very well , then . I 'll take it . " " You wo n't be sorry . " " I need to take her to the Bath presently . Will you come ? " " Me ? Why ? " " I need a woman to help me with her . " " I thought you said a woman to help me was your daughter . " " I did . " " What 's wrong with her ? " " Her skin is broken . " " Well , they have attendants at wrong with to help you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stack of Jets , pitcher of iced tea , and a break into the real world , Chicago , New York , Los Angeles , before the deluge of bathers , thirsty for something beside radioactive waters , descended on her . " It will be fine . Just do n't let her stay in too long . " " I wo n't . " " How much do I owe you for the magazines ? " " Not to worry . " " Well , then , the room is gratis . " That was fair . He felt a bit better . At the Bath a white-costumed woman showed him and the little girl into a bathroom of their own . She unveiled the child and made no comment at the sores running over her tummy and back . As she dipped the child into the waters an unholy noise bounded across the room , beating against the tile , skating the surface of the waters , testing the room 's closeness . " Nein ! Nein ! " the little girl screamed over and over again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not bubble or churn ; there was nothing to be afraid of . The salesman finally found his tongue . " What is the matter , sweetheart ? You never feel water touch your skin before this ? " But the child said nothing in response , only took some gasps of breath , and suddenly he felt like a thief , not the savior he preferred . " Nein ! Nein ! " she started up again , and the woman in white put her hand over his treasure 's mouth , clamping it tight , and holding her down in the temperate waters , rising up from the karst . She held her down the requisite fifteen minutes and then lifted her out , shaking her slightly , drying her , and only two bright tears were left , one on each cheek , and he knew if he got close enough he would be reflected in them . The woman swaddled the child in a white towel , saying , " No need to return this . " She glanced back , in wonder he was sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waters were as magic as promised maybe he would not have to return . He lifted the little girl up in his arms and felt a sharp sensation as she sank her baby teeth into his cheek , drawing blood . The salesman had tied the stack of Jets tightly , and Rosalind had to work the knife under the string , taking care not to damage the cover of the magazine on top . The string gave way and the stack slid apart . The faces of Jackie Wilson , Sugar Ray Robinson , and Dorothy Dandridge glanced up at her . A banner across one cover read " Emmett Till , The Story Inside . " She arranged herself on a wicker chaise on the verandah and began her return to the world she 'd left behind . She took the photographs-there were photographs-released by his mother-he was an only child-his mother was a widow-he stuttered-badly-these were some details-she took the photographs into her-into herself-and she would never let them go . She would burn the magazine out back with the kitchen trash-drop it in a steel drum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd give the other magazines to Hamlet as she always did-he had a scrapbook of movie stars and prize fighters and jazz musicians . The mother had insisted on the pictures , so said Jet . This is my son . Swollen by the beating-by the waters of the River **40;233;TOOLONG . Hamlet heard her soft cries out in the kitchen , over the steam of turtle meat . " Missis is all right ? " She made no answer to his question , only waved him off with one hand , the other covering the black-and-white likeness of the corpse . She did not want Hamlet to see where she came from . America 's waterways . She left the verandah and went out back . Blood trickled from the salesman 's cheek . " Is vampire you vampire , sweetheart ? " " What are you telling me ? " They were sitting on the verandah after dinner , the tourists having strolled to Milk River guided by Hamlet to watch the crocodiles in the moonlight . " Are they man-eaters ? Are they dangerous ? " one tourist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than you could possibly be of them , " Hamlet told her . The little sharp-toothed treasure was swaddled in the towel from the Bath and curled up on a chaise next to Rosalind . Tomorrow the salesman would have to buy her decent clothes . If he decided to keep her . But he must keep her . " I gave a woman twenty American dollars for her . " " What is she ? " What indeed , this blond and blue-eyed thing , filled with vanilla ice cream , bathing in the moonlight which swept the verandah . Not a hot moon tonight . Not at all . He rubbed his cheek where the blood had dried . " Her people came from overseas , long time ago . " They sat in the quiet , except for the back noise of the tropics . As if unaware of any strangeness around them . Silence . His wife would never stand for it . He might keep his treasure here . He would pay her room and board , collect her on his travels . A lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his . Why was he such a damn coward ? Rosalind would never agree to such a scheme , that he knew . But no harm in asking . It would have to wait . He 'd sleep on it . But when he woke , all he woke to was a sharp pain in his cheek . He touched the place where the pain seemed keenest , and felt a round hardness that did not soften to his touch but sent sharp sensations clear into his eyes . When he raised his eyelids the room was a blur . He waited for his vision to clear but nothing came . The red hatband was out of sight . He felt the place in the bed where his treasure had slept . There was a damp circle on the sheet . She was gone . 
##1003663 Momma tried to prepare me as best she could , shuffling between the stove and refrigerator , her slippers whispering on the linoleum ; wearing that pink quilted housecoat with the stuffing poking out the elbows . <p> In whispered monologue , her breathing keeping irregular tempo , she clutched the edge of a kitchen chair and , coughing out her lungs into a wad of tissue , delivered instructions . <p> " We have $9,000 in equity in this house .

No one else smelled smoke , but I wandered the house day and night , looking for a forgotten cigarette or burning pot .

You went to Holyoke ? I went to Simmons . " <p> We were about to play White-girl poker . Worse than Negro geography was White-girl poker , Holyoke was more celebrated than Simmons so Holly got to raise me , asking personal questions and referring to my resume for more information to best me . <p> So you live on the East Side ? So do I. " To make suse it was n't Yorkville , she asked , " You 're on 85th between -- ? " When I responded Madison and Park , she ended the game . Not revealing her address meant I 'd won the round . If I we wearing a wedding ring she would have moved on to husband roulette , as in what does your husband do ? But she , dint of birth , won the game . <p> All overdressed Black woman reeking of Giorgio and carrying a silver-plated tray with china cups and saucers , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was Holly 's secretary . She gingerly placed the tray in front of us on the Lucite coffee table . I tried unsuccessfully to make eye contact with her . <p> " Thanks , Gloria , " Holly yelled after she 'd left the room . " So , what do you think of our little setup ? " she said , handing me a cup filled with coffee . <p> I was in my best interview modeup but not perky , cool but not aloof . <p> " The offices are great , and the people seem happy , " I said . <p> " So , do you think you 'd be interested in working at View ? " <p> At least she was direct . I liked that . It could be fun , I told myself . Maybe I could even get Holly 's secretary to look me in the eye . <p> " Yes , I think it would be a challenge to come here , " I said . I 'd say just about anything now to get away from the newspaper . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few more , maybe five in addition to the ten you already gave us . Is that okay ? " <p> Fifteen references . If I were a White girl , even one who had gotten her degree through a matchbook correspondence course , five references would have been sufficient . I knew and she knew I knew this reference thing was saved just for us-Black people . Even though I did n't fit the stereotype of a gun-toting , drug-selling ghetto dweller , I was still Black and had to prove that I could fit in . It was n't about doing the job . The issue was , what kind of Negro was I ? Agreeable or angry ? I knew I had to grin and bear it , because it was just part of the Black tax . <p> " Sure , five more , that 's not a problem , " I said . <p> " Well , great . I still need to have one other editor meet you , but I 'm sure she 'll think you 're just terrif too . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humorless woman in Birkenstocks , Holly walked me to the reception area . She enthusiastically shook my hand and said she was looking forward to working with me . <p> When I got to the elevator , Gloria was standing there . This time she looked me in the eye and said hi . <p> " Hi , I 'm Alice , " I responded . The elevator opened before us . She got in first , then we were alone . <p> " So , Gloria , have you worked here long ? " <p> " Mmm , yeah , almost ten years . " <p> " Really ? So I guess you like it here ? " <p> " It 's all right . These girls is a trip , but they okay . You gon na be workin ' here ? " <p> " Um , looks like it , unless one of my five additional references says that I 'm really an axe murderer .

" <p> " Man , that 's the kind of shit I 'm talkin ' about . They do n't do that for them White girls . Three references is all they ever ask them for . " <p> " Really , are you sure ? " " Hell , yeah . Who you think has to Xerox all that shit , resumes and whatnot ? I know where everybody went to school , they grades , reference letters , everything- . " <p> I felt sick , like I wanted to throw up , but it was tempered with gratitude that I felt for what Gloria had confirmed , what I had always believed but could n't prove . Another standard , a higher hoop to jump through if you 're Black . In that split second , though , I knew I was still going to take the job so I had to be careful not to let any editor come by and see me talking with Gloria as if we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciate the information .

##1003672 Lena had never been completely comfortable with mirrors . Since she was a toddler , shc had lived in fear that anytime she looked into one , the glass would throw back more than just her reflection . Now , standing before her bathroom sink , she thought she caught a glimpse in the mirror of a figure standing behind her . She had to make herself turn and look directly into the spot where the figure had stood . It was empty . <p> I wish I had a mama or a grand I could trust to hear may sadness and not get upset , she thought . I 'd tell them just how hard it 's been . But she knew from experience that whenever she shared her sorrow and pain her fear and terror with anyone other than her best friend , Sister , the word spread so quickly through town she had to do extra duty to call everyone down . She knew no one ever intended to betray her confidence . But her sadness , it seemed , was just too heavy a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the advice of her elderly friend Miss Annie Mae : She just told her troubles to the Lord . <p> Right then Lena said a quick little personal prayer . <p> And she did feel al bit more confident as she stepped into the shower , glancing boldly into the full-length mirror by the steam-room door as she did . She stood inside the stall and listened as the percussive thump of " Sexy Noises , " her best dancing-in-the-shower music , flooded the room . Even in the early Corning light , Lena could see the outline of her favorite juniper trees outside the glass shower wall . Her mind began to wander . <p> Suddenly an unexpected sound cut through the shower spray and the seductive music . " Ahem . " <p> Lena stopped shampooing her pul ) ic hair with a soapy white shower mitt and stood stock-still , the spray from the showerhead pelting her in the chest . <p> " Is there someone out there ? " she called over the sound of the shower 's water . She hit a button on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She listened . <p> She heard it again . " Ahem . " <p> My God , " Lena gasped . " Who is that ? Who is that ? She looked around the shower stall for something , some weapon with which to defend herself . All she had was a loofah on a light balsa stick : some pink and purple herbal soaps ; shampoo and condition ; a small plastic hip -- popotamus in a hat and tutu that her godchildren had given her ; and a short bristle-back brush . She grabbed the stiff brush , knowing it was a puny defense . <p> " I 'm not in this house all by imself , " Lena shouted toward the shower door , her voice cracking and giving away her fear and deception . There was a split-second pause , then came the reply . <p> " Lena , it 's me . Herman . " <p> Lena was speechless . She thought : Now who in the hell is Herman ? He said his name as if he were identifying himself for some official position . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Herman . " <p> He had a real counttry sounding voice that had an unfamiliar , foreign taste to it , a little flat on some words but somehow smooth . He pronounced Herman as if it were " Hur-mon " with the emphasis on the first syllable . <p> " It 's me , Lena Herman . " <p> Lena started to open her mouth to scream , but she smacked her lips and felt the Sahara in there . So instead she turned the shower spigot to " C " and filled her dry mouth with cool water . It did n't help . She still could not find a voice . But she did like the sound of this Herman 's voice . <p> " Lena , I 'm a spirit , Herman said . <p> Oh God , she thought . It 's the ghosts and stuff . It 's starting again . <p> Herman kept right on talking . " Lena , I come cause you called me . I could n't ' a come if you hadn'a called me up , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I sho ' looks forward to meetin ' ya . " <p> The invitation for Lena to step outside hung in the air like steam . Lena could n't help herself She was intrigued . Her heart was still thumping in her chest , but she dropped her " weapon " and moved toward the door . She could n't believe she was doing this , but she reached her hand out and grabbed the big white Turkish towel hanging on a hoop nearby . It felt a little like sticking her hand into a dark hole at an amusement-park fun house-frightening and exciting . <p> Snatching the towel inside the stall without looking outside , Lena breathed a shaky sigh of relief : But she also felt a thrill of exhilaration . She had to stop for a second or two to catch her breath . Then she tried to wrap the fluffy white towel around herself in the least seductive fashion she could . It did not work . No matter how she threw and wrapped and twisted , she managed to look cute . So she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , heavy wet braids free of excess water and took a deep breath . <p> Surprisingly , she was not scared . She thought back to meetings she had had with other ghosts when she was younger . How her heart had raced , how the hair on her arms had stood on end , how sometimes she had felt dizzy at the sight of a headless body or huge animal or a mist or vapor covering everything in its sphere . But this time was different . Lena felt just a little anxious , like before a blind date . Under her breath she muttered , " Well , Lord , " sounding like her dead Granddaddy Walter before he embarked on an adventure . She opened the shower door all the way , letting out a puff of steam , and stepped out . Lena halfexpected the door to make a creaking noise like in a haunted house when she closed it . She steeled herself for what she was about to see , but she did n't even flinch when she turned and saw him ... Herman had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It was a face she had seen in the arrangement of leaves on a tree in the woods , a shape that was there in the sunlight , then gone in the shade . It was a face that she had seen in the clouds . It was a face that showed innate gentleness . <p> It was a face , she realized suddenly , that she had seen in her dreams . <p> Tina McElroy Ansa on the Spirit World <p> In the South of the 1950 's and 1960 's , where I was raised , Black folks talked all the time about spirits and hants , dreams and visions , feelings and ghost tales that were true . We planted by the signs of the moon , we named our children by the sudden tastes of the mother , we played the numbers by our dreams and we ended relationships by the twitch of a muscle or the ache of a scar . <p> I 've always thought that this spirit world of dead people who had been so close in life was something we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I just wanted to wallow in it . So I opened myself up to God and the universe , and the spirit world came flooding back to me . <p> The older I get , the more connected I feel to the spirit world . Perhaps with the passing of loved ones from corporeal to spirit we see that the ribbon is not broken with death . I feel closer to my brothers now than when they were alive , and I talk with my extraordinary Auntie whenever I want and need to . And in my garden , I plant vegetables by the signs of the moon . <p> Footnote 
##1003673 I should have listened to the warning about the look in those boys eyes . There were three of them leaning against the bar in the Stamp and Go , the hole of a club in West Kingston where the four of us-me , Sammy Lee Love , his pretty young wife , Lilah , and Delaware Brown-finally ended up . <p> The boys shot the lights out first . The room went black , and there was a barrage of gunfire in rapid , brutalsuccession . My breath left me like somebody had slammed me against the table . I acted with my instincts then , forgetting about everyone and everything but my own survival . <p> I slipped down into my chair and underneath the rickety table to the floor , curling my body into a tight ball , as close to the wall as I could get . Sweat slid down mv neck and between my breasts . I held my breath , afraid of the sound it would make . There was another barrage of shots , too many and too rapid to count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trying to identify it . Something small and powerful , probably a Tec-9 . Something easy to sneak into a bar under a bulk , , hooded sweatshirt . I was thinking like a cop now , but my body was trembling . I felt the table begin to shake , like somebody was throwing something against it . <p> Then everything stopped . The room was completely silent . I wondered for a moment if I was the only one alive . I pulled myself tighter , hiding from a danger I could n't see . And then somebody screamed , piercing the silence like the gunfire had a moment before . I could smell the fear in the room . <p> " Lilah ? " I whispered her name . My voice sounded st:range and distant . I thought of her vulnerability and the fear in her eyes , and how Sammy Lee Love had left his ugly , blut. marks on her thin body . <p> " Lilah ? " <p> Nobody answered . <p> Slowly my senses began to come back . A scratch on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bruised it when I 'd slipped underneath the table . I 'd felt nothing ; terror will do that to you . Somewhere Gladys Knight sang about that midnight train to Georgia . I smelled the sweet , metallic scent of fresh blood , felt it sliding down my arm . I wiped it off rubbing my hand on the gritty floor . <p> Had I been hit ? <p> But there was no pain . The blood was dripping from a crack in the table above me . <p> I noticed his sandals first . The right one was wedged against my leg and moved when I did . The leather was rich and brown and crossed against his large , misshapen toes . The hand hung down limply beside me : manicured fingers , buffed nails , a ruby ring with diamonds on either side . A pretty , girlish ring on a big man 's hand . <p> I shifted my body away from the foot , and he crumpled under the table , the way I 'd slid down earlier : legs , hips , torso , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest . And finally there was the face . Sammy Lee Love 's face . As dead as it could be . <p> " Sammy Lee , " I whispered like I expected him to answer . " Sammy Lee Love . " <p> Blood from his wound had seeped to the floor and onto my dress , making a reddishbrown border along the hem . I jumped out from under the table to avoid it . My knees hurt and my back was stiff as I stood up . The room was still dark , but the glimmer of a streetlight through the open door threw a pale , eerie glow . People were rushing toward the door , whispering in fast , urgent patois . <p> I suddenly remembered mv Kenya hag . Wherever I was going , however I was getting there , I would need my money and my passport . They were in my Kenya bag . <p> Had Sammy Lee Love knocked it out of the wai when he slipped down to the floor ? <p> I stretched forward and swept my hand in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I realized in the same instant that it had to be the knife , the one that had done the killing . I shoved it away from me with the side of mv palm . <p> I counted to ten and forced myself to take a deep breath . Then I edged close to Sammy Lee 's body again , squinting through the dark for the familiar , bulky shape of my Kenya bag . But there was nothing there . <p> She had taken it . <p> I was the vulnerable one , not Lilah Love . <p> I heard the wail of police sirens now , screaming two , maybe three blocks away . I could n't breathe for a minute and when I finally caught my breath it stuck in the top of my throat like a choke . <p> Here I was , a dead man lying at my feet , in a cheap rum joint in the middle of Kingston , Jamaica . I 'd just put my fingerprints on the knife that had killed him and his blood was smeared on the bottom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money or even proof that I had n't come here with Sammy Lee , that I had n't taken the knife that lay beside him and put it through his heart . Delaware Brown and Lilah Love were long gone , and anyone else who could verify my story had gotten out while the going was good . <p> What the hell was I going to do ? <p> Defeated , I sank back against the chair , a sense of doom overwhelming me . <p> " Tamara ! " <p> I jumped , not sure of what I heard at first , but the voice was deep and familiar . <p> " Tamara ! Come with me !

##1003674 Some say the soul tempered by fire -- tortured true -- is the better for the trial . Perhaps it is so . But I was born between the wars . My adventures were of the survivable kind , my tragedies ambiguous and undramatic , observed as much as felt . What formed me were anecdotes -- often inconclusive , generally un <p> heroic -- connected to a particular forty acres of water . An unexceptional place . I did not choose it . And yet , if I could ever open myself , I suspect I 'd find its coves there , its sleeping silt , its placental water smooth with algae . . and the faces of those I 'd known , revealed as clearly as if mine had been that lake of legend said to reflect the hidden heart . <p> I. DREAM <p> I do n't remember much : a small yellow fire burning on a flat rock , spongy ground that leaked warm as pee into my sneakers , a crushed circle of cattails , an old kerosene lantern throwing huge shadows out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , appearing by the shoreline , then gone ; my father sitting hunched on an overturned bucket ; the huge night crowding in on our little circle and the lake glass black and still and hardly like water at all . I remember the way sky met sky at the opposite shore , and I remember being afraid of that near horizon -- windowless , blank , unmoored in a night of troubling doubled stars . <p> And I remember my father dragging a huge fish smelling of mud and vegetable rot up into the lamplight . It had scales like silver dollars and a round , ugly mouth that kept kissing at the air , and I remember watching it flop heavily in the crushed reeds , leaping in and out of the shadows like a thing accustomed to the earth , thumping the damp grass . But most of all I remember my father down on the ground struggling to take out the hook , holding the great glancing body pinned under the space between his knee and foot , its head flat with his right hand , working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hook not coming out . I remember the broad bend of his back beneath his shirt , the rolled sleeves , the shine of sweat in the dark hair on his arms . He held the flashlight in his mouth , trying to see where the hook had cut into the dark red gills , raspy and stiff as combs , his hand starting to shake from the strain , and then suddenly he looked up -- he was turned half around from me -- and I saw the beam leap up over the reeds and disappear into the sky as he let his hands find their own way around steel and flesh , and then the barb was free and he had the fish in his arms like a child and had slipped it into the water and the water closed over it like a door . When we shone the light down , there was nothing there -- just the beam disappearing in green water as into some bottomless well and tiny motes of dust , myriad and fine . <p> Years later when I asked my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd never gone fishing for carp at night as far as he knew , and this much was true , he 'd never cared for fishing much , and anyway , who would the other men be ? And where would the carp come from ? Our lake had never had carp in it , and no one had heard of any being caught there . And even if he had caught a carp that size , why would he let it go ? My parents were Czech immigrants . My mother had been making carp fillets and carp roe soup for as long as I could remember . Another lake ? We had n't spent time on any other lake when I was that young -- three , four at most -- and the few relatives my parents might have let me go night fishing with were n't due to emigrate for another five years . And there were no cattails on the lake we knew and no extended shore without , on any given night , at least one lamp in a window to break the darkness . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first knew about the bottles behind the green half-curtain my mother had hung under the kitchen counter to hide the garbage can . Or when I first knew they were important . I used to go look at them sometimes when nobody was home . My favorite was a clean glass bottle with a red cap and a red label with a picture of a man on an old-fashioned sleigh pulled by huge black horses . He had red cheeks and a heavy beard and was dressed in a black bristly coat that looked like it had just come off a bear . There were great pines bent with snow and it made me think of Christmas . <p> It was around this time that the yelling started and my father slammed the door one night and the ceramic Indian by my window fell and broke off a part of his headdress . In the fall I slept under a hill of blankets in a small wooden room like a cave or a den , and when I woke up I could tell it was morning by the jays and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door . Sometimes I could see my breath . My father would usually be up by then , and I could hear him slowly crunching the newspaper into loose balls and then the snap and spit of the wood catching and the good , sharp smell of smoke , and I 'd leap out of bed and run to the big wicker chair where my pants and shirt and socks were already warming in the heat . He slept alone on the old gray couch by the wall . It had soft wom lumps like the hair on an old poodle . The cushions would be stacked on the table , and I 'd sit down on the sheets to pull on my socks and sometimes they 'd still be warm from when he 'd gotten up . The couch was a little short . I never realized that the wooden chestshoved flush against the couch-was anything more than a lampstand . <p> " Mamma still sleeping ? " I 'd ask . <p> " You 're up early , " he 'd say from the kitchen . " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But that 's not what this is about . This is about the time my father went fishing . I was about eight years old then . I spent a lot of my time elsewhere . A while before dusk my father would walk out on our dock and whistle me in for dinner . He had a good whistle and I could hear him all the way out at the dam . When I heard my mother call instead I got scared . As I ran down the small catchroot path below the orchard I could see the boat was gone . I thought first that somebody had taken it or it had floated loose and he was out looking for it . But I knew that was n't it . <p> " Come and eat your dinner , " my mother said , already walking into the cabin . <p> " Where 's Dad ? " <p> " He 's gone fishing , " she said . <p> We could see him as we ate dinner , sitting out on the empty float , the boat off the corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ float was maybe twelve feet square , a painted wood frame with a four-step ladder wired to eight empty oil drums and anchored to the bottom by a cable . As kids we played hide-and-seek between the drums , diving under to catch each other 's legs , splashing water on the spiders that built their webs in the barred gloom beneath the boards . In the summer I 'd lie on the hot wood and cup an eye to a crack and watch the bluegill and yellow perch drift up out of the cool green , disappear to the side , then drift back to view , hovering by the barrels . <p> It scared me to have him sitting out there with the sky turning dark and the insects starting up in the trees . My father could fix things and a friend had talked him into going bowhunting once when I was young , but mostly he sat at the table or up in the shack that used to be the old ham-radio station , typing . He 'd never gone fishing , never wanted to , hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was over dinner . I 'd been going on about a bass I 'd lost in the cove . " You want to catch something worthwhile , you go out in the deep water , " he said suddenly , sounding almost angry . He pointed with his fork . " It may be boring but you sit it out unless you want to piss around all your life . " My mother had started to argue , in Czech , saying what was the difference , he should let me do what I wanted , it was ridiculous , and what did he know about fishing anyway . I did n't say anything . <p> He picked up his plate . " Fine , " he said , as though I 'd been saying something . " Suit yourself . " <p> Just before dark my father sunk a hook into something that snapped the old surf-casting rod he 'd found in the shed into a deep C. I saw the tip plunge under water , jerk up , then plunge again . He stood up , fumbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though looking for help , then his arms jerked forward and he started walking , grudgingly following whatever it was he 'd hooked down there as it circled the float . My mother stood up suddenly as though to go outside , then slowly sat down again . I stared out into the near-dark , watching him do everything wrong , forcing it , holding the butt of the rod jammed to his stomach like a curved spear -- so that from a distance it looked as though he were struggling to wrench himself free of this thing , to pull it out of his body -- fighting for every foot of line hissing off into the water like it was his birthright , wanting it desperately now when five minutes earlier he 'd neither wanted nor expected much of anything at all . <p> It took almost twenty minutes . He must have had it close , because I saw him drop to one knee and , shifting the rod to his left hand , start reaching for the line . When the hooks finally straightened and the rod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then dropped to the other knee . For a moment he did n't move at all . When he put out his hands and fell on all fours like a man kicked in the stomach about to vomit , my mother got up quickly and walked to the kitchen . I went out into the dark . It took a few seconds for my eyes to adjust . He was sitting up now , perfectly still , the boat still floating obediently on its leash . <p> I did n't want to say anything . I sat on the end of the dock watching the bats , knowing he could n't see me against the shore . At some point his voice came over the water and it was like he was sitting right next to me . " Go to sleep , kid , " he said . " It 's late . " <p> He sat out all that night as the boat swung half the clock face in a slow pendulum and back , watching the shore , finally falling asleep on the cool boards , perhaps peering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lake , hoping to glimpse whatever it was that had escaped him . <p> III . Love <p> Odwin -- I never knew his full name , or whether Odwin was his first or last name -- was suddenly just there . I do n't remember him coming to the lake and I do n't remember him leaving . One day there he was in the gray rowboat , anchored in the middle of the cove in a cold June rain , and it seemed to me he 'd always been there -- I just had n't noticed him . And then one day the cove was empty and the boat half-swamped with rainwater and rotting in the muck , still tied with a rope at the bow to a post of the wooden dock , but by then it seemed like years since he 'd left and I found I did n't remember much about him at all . <p> He was married then , to a blonde girl with a pale , pretty face , considerably younger than himself . He 'd never held a rod until one afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politeness , he asked old man Klein about the spinning rod standing in the corner by the door . He held it the wrong way , with the reel sticking up into the air instead of hanging down below . Klein showed him how to hold it , how to catch the monofilament on the tip of his index finger -- not letting it slip into the crease at the joint -- how to flip the bail with his left hand , how to cast overhead and sidearm , releasing the line at just the right moment . <p> Odwin tried everything , opening and closing the bail , reeling the small , silver-bladed spinner up to the top guide , then letting it fall to the ground , his glass in its little wicker holder on the table next to him , while the three of them , growing restless , began to talk of other things , then drifted back to the kitchen for more drinks , finally returning to the living room filled with the sound of rain on the windows and barred with strange watery shadows moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there with the rod . He had an odd , soft smile on his face . He seemed mildly surprised . <p> " Where could I buy one of these ? " he said . <p> By the next afternoon , Odwin was on the lake . Rumor had it he did n't row in until well after midnight . From that day on he was unrelenting-twelve , fourteen , sixteen hours a day . In two weeks he was an expert . Rain meant nothing to him . If he was sick , we 'd hear him hacking out on the water and then at some point he would n't be sick anymore . He bought spinning reels , spin-casting reels , bait-casting reels and rods to match , dozens of spools of monofilament of various test strengths for different conditions . And lures -- hundreds and hundreds of lures . Jitterbugs and Hula-Hoppers with multicolored skirts , Rebels and spinners and Daredevil spoons , BottomBumpers and Flatfish and plastic worms in every color of the rainbow . He 'd fill up one big-belly six-drawer tackle box and start another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lubed and smooth , every knot snugged , every point on every treble hook honed and perfect . <p> I do n't remember much of any of this . I was only four and a half when he arrived on the lake . All I know I heard from someone else . And all I remember of Odwin is an impossibly tall man with black hair and a long , sad , bony face . But I remember some things . I remember watching him pull up to his dock early one evening . At night he 'd bring a portable toilet with him . While there was daylight , though , he 'd have to row in . I watched him pull in after eight or ten hours on the water , and when he tried to stand up his body remained in a sitting position . It took him some time to get out of that boat . He had to crawl out on his hands and knees . Once out of the boat he slowly lay out his entire length on the boards . He lay like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then started going about the business of standing up . That 's all I remember . <p> His wife left in the middle of the second summer . At ten in the morning she put two suitcases into the car and drove away , but not before she 'd taken every lure out of every tackle box and thrown them off the front porch into the trees . There were lures everywhere , gaudy and sharp , some in the ferns , some up in the white birches , others hanging festively off the pines . Great blue-gray nests of monofilament littered the living room , the kitchen , rolled like ghostly tumbleweeds over the stones and under the potted plants . . . Odwin was out on the boat . He did n't come in until late that afternoon . By then he was the only one on the lake who did n't know . <p> Everybody watched him pull up , throw the noose over the middle post , hoist himself painfully out of the boat . By dusk he was back on the dock . We could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because there were fireflies and he stood there for what seemed like a long time and I remember swallows flicking down around his head and you could smell the rain . The lamp in the Bauer cabin went on , making a yellow trail on the water . It ran a few feet out from Odwin 's dock like a path . You could see the water all pocked and busy , but it was n't rain yet , only gnats and mayflies and the lapping rings of fish sipping off the surface . I do n't remember seeing him get into the boat , but suddenly the pale rectangle of the dock was empty and undisturbed and the dark bulk of the boat was gone and there was just the steady creak and thump of a loose oarlock bumping against the wood . <p> There was much talk about all this , and Odwin was n't a strong man , or a ruthless one . My father was the only one who 'd speak to him still , and even he did it not for Odwin , not out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else would , which to my father had always seemed like a fine reason for doing anything . So no one was surprised when Odwin barely lasted out the season , packed his things and left . Certain kinds of love can stand only so much resistance . <p> And Odwin was the greatest of lovers in his own sad way . It was n't obsession that kept him out on that boat as the moon rose and set and the stars wheeled on their axis like a slowing merry-go-round . It was love . On a small road after dark one night ( a grown man now ) , I heard voices on a wide porch and thought for a moment they were speaking in the language I had n't heard since long before my father died . I was wrong , it was just a trick of the breeze or the night , but in those few seconds before I realized my mistake my breath had caught in my chest and tears had gushed to my eyes and I felt like a child stumbling up the final steps to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never know the particular deserts he 'd traveled , the specific thirst he had n't even known he was enduring until , like some mad Bedouin wandering the empty quarter , he stumbled upon the thing he 'd forgotten he 'd been searching for and in that moment lost not his mind but his heart . <p> The bend of reed , the shallow bulge of water , the tucked ecstasy of damselflies linked on his sleeve -- these things and a thousand like them he loved . The rods , the reels , the lures -- these were just the paraphernalia of courtship . He fished the way suitors of old would play cribbage or gin rummy , not because they cared for cards but because it was their ticket into the sanctum , into the presence of their intended . Like them , he could hardly bring himself to pay attention to the game , and , also like them , he could n't seem to lose . The lake offered up its prizes to him , and he happily dragged them home . <p> Two fish -- extravagant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first was a bass twenty-three inches long with a big potbelly and a mouth twice the size of a man 's fist , this out of a lake where anything over fifteen inches would magically attract small knots of boys who would hover nearby , whispering and pointing , and who would n't leave until the fish ( gutted , cleaned , and wrapped ) had disappeared in the freezer . <p> But the other was unforgettable . My father woke me early one morning to see it . " You do n't want to miss this , " he said . " Odwin 's dragged up something special . " It was laid out on the stones of the veranda when we got there , a gleaming yellow-green beast fully half the length of an oar . I was six and a half that summer . I 'd never seen a pickerel before . I remember there was moss and little tufts of grass growing between the rocks . My father walked out back to look for Odwin . <p> It was getting hot . I stared at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the partly open mouth still locked on the diving minnow lure he 'd caught it on , the way the colors faded into the dark-olive back . . . I remember the yellow jacket that settled on its long , bill-like snout and moved down the jaw , tentatively touching the cartilage flap of the mouth , the teeth , then the dark green cheek plate near the eye . The fish did n't move . I stood away . There was something horrible about this : the delicate , strangled body , the venomous yellow abdomen twitching spastically , edging toward that great staring eye . I half expected the fish to start thrashing at any moment and I remember I thought of walking away , and even started to , but the wasp was already at the rim of that clouding pool . And I saw its forelegs dip down-gently , almost respectfully-and it was like a swimmer testing familiar water , or an acolyte paying homage at some long-forgotten shrine . <p> IV . FEAR <p> They moved into the cabin up the hill in midsummer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man laugh and then a woman squealing , " Put me down , you bastard , I swear I 'll kill you , I 'll . . . , " and we saw him walk out on the dock holding on to her legs and her beating on his back with her fists , and then he grabbed his hat , turned once , and flung her fully clothed and furious into the water . " Looks like neighbors , " my father said . From that moment on the lake adjusted to a new topography . My world circled around them like a plate on a pin . <p> It was particularly hot that summer , or maybe I just remember it that way . Every morning the cicadas would ratchet up and by breakfast the sky would start to whine and all day a thin head of clouds would build to the west but nothing ever happened . Even swimming did n't help-the top three feet were as warm as the air . We 'd dive down into the olive dusk , cold as mud , and hug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floating up , but that only made the surface and the overheated air still worse . Sitting on the boat I 'd listen to the birds fighting in the locked maples over the road . I was like the blackwater pockets in the spillway by the dam-choking , crazy with life . <p> On a boat one afternoon with the water stamped flat and hot , I pulled in a small bass with a minnow still sticking out of its throat . I tugged on the minnow 's tail and it slipped out of the creamy vortex of guts as easily as a cooked almond slides out of its skin . All afternoon I 'd been dunking my head over the stem . And suddenly I did something I did n't know I was going to do : I put the tip of my finger where the minnow had been , to see what it was like . The inside of the fish 's throat was smooth as tapioca pudding , and when I pushed deeper it started to swallow at me with quick , hard draws and I jerked my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water so hard it skipped . It seemed like everything was like that . I hardly knew what I 'd do next . I was quick to anger , quick to tears , an utter mystery to myself . <p> Things would change in ways I did n't expect . Cleaning fish , for example . I 'd been doing it since I was seven . I 'd hold them in an old pink towel with just their head sticking out and give them a good whack with a smooth , bent iron , then put the tip of the knife into the shithole and cut up through the belly to the gills . The knife would make a soft , ropy sound and the white skin would collapse a bit like a man pulling in his cheeks , and if you lifted up a side you could see the guts all connected . The heart was right up front , tucked under the gills : small , dull-red , easy to pop . It reminded me of the thin little bubbles we used to suck and twist out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stomach , sort of a mud-colored bag : inside you could sometimes find whole minnows , crawfish . . . once I found a small frog turned creamy white and another time a fake gold earring . I never went near the gall bladder . I 'd cut it once by accident , and it leaked thick and yellow and smelled like old men 's pee and reminded me of that time at the city train station a man had stood next to me looking straight up at the ceiling like there was some message written there and all the time shaking his wrinkled cock like an old dog wags its tail . <p> Against the vaulted roof of the spine was a dove-gray bladder you could poke with your finger . I 'd always liked doing this but that summer for some reason I started trying not to . I 'd make little bets with myself , imagining rewards , picturing horrors if I did n't stop . Usually I 'd do it anyway . It would n't hiss or pop but only tear thin and sweet , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , picking out the little bits of blood with my fingers . It was that way with everything , more or less . <p> There were three of them , the oldest hardly twenty-two , polite and somehow dangerous , and it surprised no one when the state police appeared on the dirt road and pulled into their drive , only that they left soon afterward , taking no one with them . There was one who 'd call out to me sometimes when I rowed by . He 'd be sitting up on the stone porch with his boots up on the rail wearing only a pair of pants and a big broad hat with a turned rim , and he 'd ask me how the fishing was or where I thought he 'd have the best luck , and sometimes somebody else would say something from inside and he 'd say " Why do n't you shut up , Tucker " without even turning around , and I 'd row away , repeating the words he 'd said and the way he 'd said them , flattered that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see her leaning in the dark of the doorway , eating something off a paper plate with her hands , then licking her fingers . It was always hot , and sometimes she 'd turn half away and lift the hair off the back of her neck with her forearms . <p> Every night as lightning flashed like some rapid code above the horizon of trees they 'd be out on the boat , setting a trotline from the end of their dock to a branch hanging over the water . The next morning one of them would lift the line with a grunt , and there , dangling on the end of a dozen small leaders , would be footlong bullheads , black-speckled crappies , sometimes a bass or a small snapping turtle . Then somebody would go out and pull hand over hand along the line , cutting the fish into the boat with a pair of scissors , dumping the rest over the side . I 'd never seen a trotline before . <p> " Hell , easy , " said the one who talked to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to skin a catfish . " <p> The sky had been rumbling since noon , and where the path left the uncut meadow and entered the trees it was like dusk . It was hot , and when I slapped at the gnats and deerflies that circled around my face they stuck to my skin and hair and I had to pick them loose with my fingers . They were all sitting on the porch when I got there . Music was coming from inside and I could see him already working on the fish , straddling a bench with a cleaning board nailed to it crossways , the fish jammed in a bucket of water by his side . <p> She was lying in a hammock strung between a hook in the cabin wall and another sunk into the tree at the corner of the porch , wearing only a long skirt and a man 's sleeveless T-shirt , and I could see the sweat on her arms and her throat and the damp curve of her breathing . The hammock was barely moving . She 'd pulled up her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tipped outward slightly , then closed with each swing of the pendulum . Her arm , hanging loose over the side , trailed slowly over the rocks . She 'd been facing my way when I appeared by the side of the cabin . She did n't say anything -- if her eyes had been closed I 'd have thought she was sleeping -- and after a few moments simply turned her head the other way . One of the men got up and walked into the cabin . No one else said anything either . <p> He must have known I was there all along . " Well , come over here , boss , " he said , without turning around . " You ever see this before ? " I could see sweaty curls of black hair sticking out from under his hat . Reaching into the bucket , he pulled out a foot-long bullhead , lay it bellydown on the board , and quickly poked a small hole in the top of its skull with the tip of the fillet knife , then , reaching up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straw and slipped it into the hole . Suddenly I felt myself swallowing high up in my throat like I was going to be sick . The tail trembled with current . He moved the straw , delicately , as though mixing a small drink , and the fish shuddered again and was still . " See that ? " he said . <p> A man 's voice said something from the house , and I could hear her laugh behind me . " Why do n't you give your little friend a drink , Troy ? " Her voice was like her fingers tracing over the rocks . Again the other said something I could n't make out . She turned to the house . " Maybe I will , asshole . At least he 'd know what to do with it . " <p> I could n't move . I could n't say anything . I was suddenly just scared . I could see the lake , still and dark as oil , but everything looked different from here-the tilting , unfamiliar dock , the float on its barrels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had snapped or the anchor broken loose . . . Through a space in the leaves I could see my father walk out on our dock , and it was as though I were seeing him from another world . I willed him to stay . I watched him light a cigarette with quick , familiar movements . After a while he turned and walked back , disappearing . A fish swirled tight by the shore . <p> " You make a cut here , " the man said , and I watched him slice in a half-circle behind the gills and again at the base of the tail and four more lengthwise and then , grabbing a small flap of skin with a pair of pliers , peel the brown skin down like you would a banana , baring the clean white meat underneath . Two quick moves and the whiskered head , spine , and tail dropped on an open newspaper . He reached for another . I wanted to run . <p> I do n't know how long I stood there , trapped by things I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pliers going about their business , and at my back the gently creaking mesh , the small sounds of exhaustion-a long sigh , a stretching yawn . <p> I knew he was there before I heard the hammock move behind me . " Hello , " she said , startled . <p> I turned around . " I thought I might find you here , " he said quietly , looking at me . " If you 're hungry , it 's time for dinner . " <p> We went back up the hill and into the light of the meadow , neither of us saying anything . Here and there I could see the lake through the trees , rearranging itself . A flash of light crackled low on the horizon and a few fat drops hit the tall grasses , making them jerk and nod in the still air . <p> " Come on , let 's run , " said my father . <p> V. TRUTH <p> And then there was the water at the dam that spilled over the boards in their iron sleeves and down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doomed to only a season , maybe two , before the next big rain in May or June ripped them loose and sent them rushing down the current . <p> This was small water : a short , undercut bank , a thigh-deep hole along a toppled tree still partly rooted , its branches now growing vertically like trees in their own right but still feeding off that troubling , recumbent soil . No one over twelve would notice it . Where the spillway flattened out and ran under the one-lane wooden bridge , it slowed to a stream less than five strides across . The bridge was so low you could n't stand up , and when cars rumbled over , sand and small pebbles would hiss into the water and the boards would groan and you 'd wonder if this was the time they 'd give and crack and the steel belly of some car would come crushing down into the wet , dark place you were hiding in . That stream was crammed full of fish ( trapped by the dam on one end and a long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the spillway as fingerlings : bluegill and pumpkinseed and redear , the occasional bullhead or perch or small bass . The shadows were ridged and thick with their backs , and they 'd churn across the shallows in great , nervous schools . We 'd chase them back and forth for hours with our nets , herding them like sheep into the dead ends under the rocks and banks and back under the bridge against the base of the spillway , trying to see how many we could get to a scoop . <p> It had been raining for a week and now it had stopped , though everything still ran water and the clouds scraped low and heavy over the hills . The lake was brown , the trees along the shore a foot deep in water . I went down to the stream to see what it was like , carrying a longhandled salmon net I used for snapping turtles on the open lake . It had a two-inch mesh , much too big for anything I might find there , but I 'd torn the netting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I could hear the water long before I got to the bridge , bigger now , bulging up over the fallen tree and rushing in a straight gray line through the woods . The water looked barrenscoured smooth and dead . I sat on the bridge for a while , watching broken half-tunnels of bark and leafy branches appear from under the wood and disappear downstream and then , having nothing better to do , got up to walk along the bank . Fifty yards down I recognized a small , sink-sized pool , relatively unchanged , and stuck the handle in to test the strength of the current . <p> A tail wide as a dinner plate slapped the water and disappeared . I stared as though a large pig had stuck its snout above the surface , snorted , and vanished . It was simply impossible . This was a bluegill hole hardly bigger than a kitchen pot . A fish that large would have to be curled like a doughnut to fit at all . <p> At age ten the eyes still occasionally win over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stabbed it into the hole ( so narrow the rim just made it ) , and , leaning in , forked a huge fish with big silver scales out onto the bank . It promptly flopped out of the mesh . I tackled it , literally wrestled it flat . I probably screamed when it finned me in the stomach ( it must have hurt , and I flaunted the neat row of small black puncture holes like a certificate of honor for weeks ) , but I do n't remember . <p> I do remember leaving the net behind and dragging the fish by the gills ( which also cut me fairly well , as I discovered later ) , almost half a mile back down the grassy middle of the road as it started to rain again and the fish revived every few minutes just enough to thrash loose and leap across the dirt and into the roadside weeds . Pictures were taken . No one had ever seen a carp around there before . It measured thirty-four inches by the yellow cloth tape my mother kept in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the button that sucked it all back in when you pressed it . My mother wanted to keep the fish for soup , but it would have been a big job and it was raining and the fish still alive , its plate-size gills working hard , so we picked it up and hauled it to the end of the dock and threw it like a log into the water . It lay stunned just beneath the hissing rain , then churned into the dark . " Be a lonely life , " my father said . " Nothing like him in this puddle , that 's for goddamn sure . " <p> It had probably come up from the river with the big rain , he 'd said . It would be years before I 'd remember a circle of lamplight stamped from the darkness , a horizon dark as dream , my father dragging a fish with scales like silver dollars into the sudden air-years before I 'd be old enough to believe that life , like water , will sometimes engineer its own logic , adjust itself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

You have n't even got up once in the middle of the night to change her goddamn diaper even as a token fucking gesture of support , so do n't you tell me what I should do with my breasts . There 's nothing wrong with formula . I was raised on formula . You were raised on formula . Our whole generation was raised on formula and we 're fine . So just shut up about it . Just shut up . Because this is n't about you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breast-feed , I would do it gladly ! " he hisses . Flings the blankets back and stomps to the crib . <p> And I laugh . I laugh because the sucker said the words out loud . It is 3:27 A.M. The baby has woken up . Your breasts are heavy with milk but you supplement her with formula . At 5:15 , you supplement her again and your breasts are so full , so tight , that they lie like marble on your chest . They are ready . <p> You change the baby 's diaper and put her into the crib . In the low glow of the baby light , you can see her lips pursed around an imaginary nipple . She even sucks in her sleep . You sit on the bed , beside your partner , and unsnap the catches on your nursing bra . The pads are soaked and once the nipples are exposed , they spurt with sweet milk . The skin around your breasts is stretched tighter than a drum , so tight that all you need is one little slice for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it tears , spreading across the surface of your chest , directed by your fingers , in a complete circle around your entire right breast . There is no blood . <p> You lean slightly forward and the breast falls gently into your cupped hands . The flesh is a deep red and you wonder at its beauty , how flesh becomes food without you asking or even wanting it . You set the breast on your lap and slice your other breast . Two pulsing orbs still spurting breast milk . You gently tug the blankets down from the softly clenched fingers of your sleeping partner , unbutton his pajamas and fold them back so his chest is exposed . You stroke the hairless skin , then lift one breast , then the other , to lie on top of his flat penny nipples . The flesh of your breasts seeps into his skin , soft whisper of cells joining cells , your skin into his , tissue to tissue , the intimate melding before your eyes , your mouth an " 0 " of wonder and delight . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restless , a soft moan between parted lips . They are no longer spurting with milk , but they drip evenly , runnels down his sides . The cooling wet becomes uncomfortable and his eyelids flutter . He focuses on my face peering down and blinks rapidly . <p> " What 's wrong ? " he asks , voice dry with sleep . <p> " Nothing . Not a thing . How do you feel ? " " Funny , " he answers , perplexed . " My chest feels funny . I feel all achy . Maybe I 'm coming down with something . My chest is wet ! I 'm bleeding ! " <p> " Shhhhh . You 'll wake the baby , " I caution . Gently press my forefinger over his lips . <p> He was groggy with sleep , but he is wide awake now . Sitting up . Looks down at his chest , his two engorged breasts . He looks at my face . Then back at his breasts . <p> " Oh , my god , " he moans . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry . Everything is fine . Just do what comes naturally . " <p> A sudden look of shock slams into his face and he reaches , panicked , with his hands to touch himself between his legs . When he feels himself intact , relief flits his eyes to be permanently replaced by bewilderment . <p> I smile . Beam in the dim glow of light . Turn onto my side and sleep sweetly , soundly.Ms . <p> Footnote 
##1003677 These days everyone was a cuckold . And why not , when marriage was insufficient to satisfy most human need ? <p> ALL week Bill had been looking forward to this moment . He was about to fuck the daughter of the man who had fucked his wife . Lying in her bed , he could hear Celestine humming in the bathroom as she prepared for him . It had been a long time since he 'd been in a room so cold , with no heating . After a while he ventured his arms over the covers , tore open a condom , and laid it on a cardboard box that served as a bedside table . He was about to prepare another , but did n't want to appear overoptimistic . One would achieve his objective . He would clear out then . Already there had been too many delays . The waltz , for instance , though it had made him giggle . Nevertheless , he had told Madelaine , his pregnant wife , that he would be back by midnight . What could Celestine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shower ; and the wind cut viciously through a broken window . His wife had met Celestine 's father , Vincent Ertel , the French ex-Maoist intellectual , in Paris . He had certainly impressed her . She had talked about him continually , which was bad enough , and then rarely mentioned him , which , as he understood now , was worse . Madelaine worked on a late-night TV discussion program . For two years she had been eager to profile Vincent 's progress from revolutionary to Catholic reactionary . It was , she liked to inform Bill-using a phrase that stayed in his mind -indicative of the age . Several times she went to see Vincent in Paris ; then she was invited to his country place near Auxerre . Finally she brought him to London , to record the interview . When it was done , to celebrate , she took him to Le Caprice for champagne , fish cakes , and chips . That night Bill had put aside the script he was directing and gone to bed early with a ruler , a pencil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was becoming particularly enthusiastic about Vincent , Bill had made up his mind not only to study the great books-the densest and most intransigent , the ones from which he 'd always flinched -but to underline in them , and even to memorize certain passages . The effort to concentrate was torment , as his mind flew about . Yet most nights-even during the period when Madelaine was preparing for an encounter with Vincenthe kept his light on long after she had put hers out . Determined to swallow the thickest pills of understanding , he would lie there muttering phrases he wanted to retain . One of his favorites was Emerson 's " We but half express ourselves , and are ashamed of that divine idea which each of us represents . " One night Madelaine opened her eyes and said with a quizzical look , " Ca n't you be easier on yourself ? " Why ? He would n't give up . He had read biology at university . Surely he could n't be such a fool as to find these books beyond him . His need for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need for sleep . How could a man have come to the middle of his life with barely a clue about who he was or where he might go ? The heavy volumes represented the highest , surely , that man 's thought had flown ; they had to include guidance . The close , leisurely contemplation afforded him some satisfaction-usually because the books started him thinking about other things . It was the part of the day he preferred . He slept well , usually . But on the long night of the fish cakes he awoke at four and felt for Madelaine across the bed . She was n't there . Shivering , he walked through the house until dawn , imagining she 'd crashed the car . After an hour he remembered that she had n't taken it . Maybe she and Vincent had gone on to a late-night place . She had never done anything like this before . He could neither sleep nor go to work . He decided to sit at the kitchen table until she returned , whenever it was . He was drinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evening . If anyone offered him a drink before this time , he claimed it was like saying good-bye to the whole day . In the mid-eighties he 'd gone to the gym in the early evening . For some days , though , good-bye was surely the most suitable word . It was late afternoon before his wife returned , wearing the clothes she 'd gone out in , looking disheveled and uncertain . She could n't meet his eye . He asked her what she 'd been doing . She said , " What do you think ? " and went into the shower . He considered several options , including punching her . But he fled the house and made it to a pub . For the first time since he 'd been a student , he sat alone with nothing to do . He was expected nowhere . He had no newspaper with him , and he liked papers ; he could swallow the most banal or incredible thing provided it was in newsprint . He watched the passing faces and thought how pitiless the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . He made himself consider how unrewarding it was to constrain people . Infidelities would occur in most relationships . These days every man or woman was a cuckold . And why not , when marriage was insufficient to satisfy most human need ? Madelaine had needed something and she had taken it . How bold and stylish . How petty to blame someone for pursuing any kind of love ! He was humiliated . The feeling increased over the weeks in a strange way . At work or waiting for the tube , or having dinner with Madelaine ( who had gained , he could see , a bustling , dismissive intensity of will or concentration ) , he found himself becoming angry with Vincent . For days on end he could n't really think of anything else , as if the man were inhabiting him . As he walked around Soho , where he worked , Bill entertained himself by thinking of how someone might get even with a type like Vincent , were he so inclined . The possibility was quite remote , but this did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some satisfaction , if not credit . What incentive , distraction , energy , and interest Vincent provided him with ! This was almost the only creative work he got to do now . FEW days later he was presented with Celestine . She was sitting with a man in a newly opened cafe , drinking cappuccino . Life was giving him a chance . It was awful . He stood in the doorway , pretending to look for someone , and considered whether he should take it . Vincent 's eldest daughter lived in London . She wanted to be an actress , and Bill had auditioned her for a commercial a couple of years earlier ; he knew that she 'd obtained a small part in a film directed by an acquaintance of his . On this basis he crossed the cafe , introduced himself , made the pleasantest conversation he could , and was invited to sit down . The man turned out to be a gay friend of hers . They all chatted . After some timorous vacillation Bill asked Celestine in a cool tone whether she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours . He did n't go home but walked about . When he was tired , he sat in a pub with the first volume of Remembrance of Things Past . He had decided that if he could read to the end of the book he would deserve a great deal of praise . He did a little underlining , which since school he had considered a sign of seriousness , but his mind wandered even more than usual until it was time to meet her . To his delight Bill saw that some men glanced at Celestine when they could ; others openly stared . When she walked to the bar , they turned to examine her legs . This would not have happened with Madelaine ; only Vincent Ertel had taken an interest in her . Later , as he and Celestine strolled up the street looking for cabs , she agreed that he could come to her place at the end of the week . It was a triumphant few days of gratification anticipated . He would do more of this . He had obviously been missing out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flat , dressing , cooking , reading , searching for her glasses , he could enjoy despising her . He informed his two closest friends that the pleasures of revenge were considerable . He liked saying that the French were used to being occupied . Now his pals were waiting to hear of his coup . Celestine flung her keys , wrapped in a tea towel , out a window . It was a hard climb : her flat was at the top of a rundown five-story building in West Kensington , an area of itinerants , bed-sits , and students . Coming into the living room , he saw it had a view across a square . Wind and rain were sweeping into cracked windows stuffed with newspaper . The walls were yellow , the carpet brown and stained . The gas fire , which had several pairs of jeans suspended in front of it on a clotheshorse , gave off an odor , and heated parts of the room while leaving others cold . She persuaded him to remove his overcoat but not his scarf . Then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floorboards ; between an old sink and the boiler there was hardly room for the two of them . " I will be having us some dinner . " She pointed to two shopping bags . " Do you like troot ? " " Sorry ? " It was trout . There were potatoes and green beans . After , they would have apple strudel with cream . She had been to the shops and gone to some trouble . It would take ages to prepare . He had n't anticipated this . He left her there , saying he would fetch drink . In the rain he went to the off-license and was paying for a bottle of wine when he noticed through the window that a taxi had stopped at the traffic lights . He ran out of the shop to hail the cab , but after he opened the door , he could n't go through with it . He collected the wine and carried it back . He waited in her living room , pacing and drinking . She did n't have a TV . Wintry noises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd shared as a student . He was about to say to himself Thank God I 'll never have to live like this again when it occurred to him that if he left Madelaine , he might , for a time , end up in some unfamiliar place , with stained , old , broken fittings . How fastidious he had become ! How had it happened ? What other changes had there been while he was looking in the other direction ? He noticed a curled photograph tacked to the wall ; it looked as though it had been taken at the end of the sixties . Bill concluded that it was a picture of the hopeful radical who 'd fucked his wife . He had been a handsome man , and with his pipe in his hand , hair below his ears , and an opennecked shirt , he had an engaging look of self-confidence and raffish pleasure . Bill recalled the slogans that had then decorated Paris : " Everything Is Possible . " " Take Your Desires for Realities . " " It Is Forbidden to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV commercial . What optimism that generation had had ! With his life given over to literature , ideas , conversation , writing , and political commitment , ol " Vincent must have had quite a time . He could n't have been working constantly , like Bill and his friends . The food was good . Bill leaned across the table to kiss Celestine . His lips brushed her cheek . She turned her head and looked out across the dark square to the lights beyond , as if trying to locate something . He talked about the film industry and what the actors , directors , and producers of the movies were really like . Not that he knew them personally , but they were gossiped about by other actors and technicians . She asked questions and laughed easily . Things should have been moving along . He had to get up at 5:30 to direct a commercial for a bank . He was becoming known for such well-paid but journeyman work . Now that Madelaine was pregnant , he would have to do more of it . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screenwriting he wanted to do . It was dawning on him that if he was to do anything worthwhile at his age , he would have to be serious in a new way . And yet , when he considered his ambitions , which he no longer mentioned to anyone-to travel overland to Indonesia while reading Proust . . . and other , more " internal " things-he felt a surge of shame , as if it were immature and obscene to harbor such hopes ; as if , in some ways , it was already too late . He shuffled his chair around the table until he and Celestine were sitting side by side . He attempted another kiss . She stood up and offered him her hands . " Shall we dance ? " He looked at her in surprise . " Dance ? " " It will " ot you up . Do n't you . . dance ? " " Not really . " " Why ? We always danced like this . " He shut his eyes and " Why ? We always danced like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bang in a nail with his She kicked off her shoes . " We danced like this head as if attempting to bang in a nail with his " I 'll illustrate you . " She looked at him . " Take it off . " " The kicked off her shoes . " We danced like this , " she said . " I 'll illustrate you . " She looked at him . " Take it off . " " What ? " " on a Chopin waltz , took his hand , and placed her other hand on his back . He looked down at her dancing feet even as he trod on them , but she did n't object . Gently but firmly she turned and turned him across the room , until he was dizzy , her hair tickling his face . Whenever he glanced up , she was looking into his eyes . Each time they crossed the room , she trotted back , pulling him , never unamused . She seemed determined that he should learn , certain that this would benefit him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last . He fell back into his chair , blowing and laughing . " But after a week , who knows , we could get you work as a gigolo ! " IT was midnight . Celestine came naked out of the bathroom , smoking a cigarette . She got into the bed and lay beside him . He thought of a time in New York when the company had sent a white limousine to the airport . Drinking whiskey and watching TV as the limo passed over the East River toward Manhattan , he wanted nothing more than for his friends to see him . She was on him vigorously , and the earth was moving : either that , or the two single beds , on the juncture of which he was lying , were separating . He stuck out his arms to secure them , but with each lurch his head was being forced down into the fissure . He felt as if his ears were going to be torn off . The two of them were about to crash through to the floor . He rolled her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed her what would have happened . She started to laugh ; she could n't stop . The gas meter ticked . She was dozing . He had never lain beside a lovelier face . He thought of what Madelaine might have sought that night with Celestine 's father-affection , attention , serious talk , honesty , distraction . Did he , Bill , give her that now ? Could they give it to each other ? With a kid on the way ? Celestine was nudging him and trying to say something in his ear . " You want what ? " he said . " Surely . . . no . . . no . " " Bill , yes . " He liked to think he was willing to try anything . A black eye would certainly send a convincing message to her father . She smiled when he raised his hand . " I deserve to be hurt . " " No one deserves that . " " But you see . . . I do . " That night , in that freezing room , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she asked , for as long as she wanted-he had never kissed anyone for so longuntil he forgot where he was , or who they both were , until there was nothing that they wanted , and only the most satisfactory peace . He got up and dressed . He was shivering . He wanted to wash-he smelled of her-but he was n't prepared for a cold bath . " Why are you leaving ? " She leaped up and held him . " Stay , stay-I have n't finished with you yet . " He put on his coat and went into the living room . Without looking back he hurried out and down the stairs . He pulled the knob of the front door , anticipating the fresh , damp night air . But the door held . He had forgotten : the door was locked . He stood there . Upstairs she was wrapped in a fur coat , looking down the stairwell . " The key , " he said . " Old man , " she said , laughing . " You are . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , he mumbled , " Will you tell your father I saw you ? " " But why ? " He touched her face . She drew back . " You should put something on that , " he said . " I met him once . He knows my wife . " " I rarely see him now , " she said . She was holding out her arms . They danced a few steps across the hall . He was better at it now . He went out into the street . Several cabs passed him , but he did n't hail them . He kept walking . The rain was comforting . He put his head back and looked up into the sky . He had some impression that happiness was beyond him and everything was coming down , and that life could not be grasped but only lived . 
##1003680 POETRY : JOY . Far away from everything I am deep in sparkling snow and evergreen forest The wind is flying by me , and the air is crisp with cold I feel free and content I am ready for the hills I crouch down , and off I go I am flying The world has never seemed so open and pure I see a deer as graceful as a flower Bow her head and drink from shining water The birds chirp their joyful song Chipmunks run in quick streaks You may ask where does such joy come from I will answer I am skiing <p> 
##1003681 POETRY : TRISKET . I 've got a little mischief maker , In other words , a dog . His name is Trisket . He eats like a hog . He followed us to the bakery one day , And we still do n't know , even today , How he got out of the car , out of the way , Into the bakery . Well , anyway , he did , and Ate all the bread , Ate all the cake , ice cream , And cookies too . Oh no ! Next thing Catch that dog ! Catch that dog ! You mean the big hungry hog ? Phew ! Back in the car , back in the car , Going home , going home , Are n't you glad it 's over ? Well , so am I ! <p> 
##1003683 Not long after civil war broke out in Yugoslavia , he put his lips on me for the first time . I did n't know then that a few weeks earlier , under the sloping , gabled ceiling and with the steady tiptap of the kitchen faucet drip , in the same set of plain rooms where he lived , he had been making love to a Yugoslavian woman . I did n't even know he had been to Yugoslavia , or that she had been here . But throughout the nearly two years of our knowing each other , the nightly news has provided a constant reminder-of the horrors we try to shut out , of the tenuous and threatened quality of love , of M- . The war keeps her possibility continually in front of us . Behind the glass of the TV screen , we might glimpse her , like a museum piece , untouchable and precious . I tell myself that otherwise he would have forgotten her . <p> When I ask him about his attraction to M- , he says that if more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , a wonderful place . He tells me this repeatedly , because I ask repeatedly , never quite getting a clear picture of her or of why he believes this . His sense of her seems vague , and I wonder what he means . <p> The world would be better , I ask , if women came from far away , with their hairs-oh , those endearing translations-their hairs falling from behind enameled barrettes , falling across mouths spilling an English softened by accent and imprecise meaning , lips moistened with tongues of inarticulate desire , their bodies unexplained , their motives shadowy ? If women came from far away , for a few nights , not expecting talk to clarify anything but the shine of saliva on shy teeth or the dimple of a cheek , if they accepted that conversation is made only for the music , that the words are no more than wind riffling brittle leaves , horses chuffing and snorting in the hay , babies sucking ? If women said , " I will never see you again . This only chance , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and never came back ? The world would be better ? Being in the world , I wonder if he thinks that 's what I should work toward , being more like M- . But I am not exotic ; I do not soar into the clouds , or into war . <p> I do n't know whether she is Croat , Serb , or Muslim , and I do n't think he knows , either , though I surmise she is a Croat , being from Zagreb . She is one of the educated , tolerant ones , the glue in the middle of her country that has come unstuck . I do n't know her or much at all about her , except that he met her at a professional meeting in Dubrovnik and that , instead of attending important sessions , she took the afternoon off to show him the medieval city . I envision them walking along the tops of the white marble walls , looking out over the terra cotta tile roofs at the Adriatic gleaming like a hot sheet of mottled aluminum in the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other , they made their way through the crowds of tourists . They climbed to the top of the Minceta Tower , where the sunlight refracted off the water into their eyes , blindingly , and when they came down and shuffled along outside the city walls in the flickering shade of the trees of the Put Iza Grada , he stopped her and kissed her once , lightly , and took her picture before they headed back to the Grand Imperial Hotel , where their colleagues awaited them for the closing dinner of the conference . " Perfect honeymoon territory , " he first described it to me . " If you could n't lose yourself in someone there , then you 'd never be able to . " <p> Back home , he joked with her via e-mail , and when she came to visit relatives in the United States , she made an excursion to see him . He and J- , his soon-to-be-ex-lover , met her at the train station , and M- 's face registered surprise and disappointment . He had n't told her there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught up in the mood of the big party scheduled for that weekend , a blowout that has since become legendary , canonized for description at all subsequent pallid parties where I have been . There was a rented hot tub steaming into the cool , glassy , black October sky ; kabobs charring and smoking on the grill in the side yard ; and lots and lots of drunk people . I have heard over and over how she went wild for splashing in the tub , engaging everyone in the fracas , leaping in and jumping out to follow one or another of the guys to the kitchen for a fresh beer , her laugh echoing and high . The guys still talk about M- and their hard-ons for her , even though " she was n't that pretty . " There was just " something " about her . I wonder , again , if it was her temporary nature , her communal willingness , or her childish speech and laughter that made up for the unabashedly adult European body hair they would find so despicable on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was somehow charming , or if she shaved for them . " She obviously wants you , " the gang told him . " You 're crazy if you do n't do her . " <p> Evidently agreeing , he told J- not to stay over those nights because it would make M- feel awkward , and he told M- that J- was just a friend of his , not a lover . And he had sex with M- three times , each night of her visit after the party . Since I 've always found such encounters disappointing , I asked him if it was good . " Yes , " he said . " Not the best , but very pleasant . " Did he put his arms around her knees and his face in her lap as she sat in the ugly orange rocker where I sat the first night I spent with him ? Did they embrace on the couch in front of the TV before going to the bedroom ? Did they just roll onto the floor , bumping heads against the cabinet where the wineglasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheets were on the bed ? Was her underwear provocative , specially chosen for her American adventure , for him ? Did they watch the sunset from the window in the shower , rubbing soap languorously into each other 's wet hair ? What was the same ? What was different ? Well , for one thing , only three times invokes a charm . A few days are temporary enough to be romantic , though the brevity of a lifespan is not . <p> She sent him a Christmas card from Zagreb , with a note about her work and a line about her " good time " with him and his friends . Like the speech that I imagine for her , the letter was full of sweet errors . She signed her name with an angular flourish . And then she disappeared . <p> IMG 
##1003684 A five-year-old child had been lost ; the men of the town had gotten together a search ; they 'd found the boy and he was fine . Why not celebrate ? <p> BUSY night , " Byron said , over the noise , when Brenda set his beer on the bar in front of him . " For a weeknight , " she agreed . " Hear you found that little deaf boy . " " Yup , " he said , and raised the bottle in a mock toast . Brenda gave the bar a pat . " On the house-excuse me , " she said , and went to wait on somebody else . He watched her go , sorry , vaguely and not for the first time , that he was n't the least bit in love with her . She reminded him pleasantly of a girl in Texas , almost fifteen years before . " Hey , Doatze , " Mike Connor called from down the bar . Byron nodded back at him , and then at the other men with him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Byron came in , he could stand at the bar and joke with Brenda for three beers and be interrupted only once or twicethe place stayed that quiet . But tonight , as if the tornado two days ago , or last night 's search , had changed even the Rainbow , the place was so full he could hardly hear himself think . Brenda went behind the bar again , uncapped a fresh beer , and set it in front of him . " It 's on Frenchie , " she said , pointing toward the back of the barroom . " I 'll be damned , " Byron said , because Frenchie 'd never bought anybody a beer , and that made Brenda laugh , so he said , " I better get out of here before chickens grow teeth . " " Oh , you , " Brenda said , taking a little slap at his shoulder . Then somebody called her . Byron caught Frenchie 's eye , raised the second beer , and nodded his thanks . Maybe it was that-thanking somebody he did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the noise in a place he preferred quiet , but he 'd come for something else , and he did n't know what . He took another swallow and gave up . Next thing he knew he 'd be feeling sorry for himself , and even as he thought that , he thought of Maude Nash and how she 'd made fun of him the night before last in her kitchen . What a clean , surprising thing talking with her had been . And she did n't remind him at all of that old lost chance in Texas . He pulled a dollar from his pocket and tucked it under his bottle . He had n't planned on giving Brenda a blow-by-blow of the search , but there were a few things he 'd have liked the chance to say , maybe just to hear how they sounded . And he sure did n't want to say them to Frenchie , or Mike , or any of the rest of them . " ' Night , " he called to Brenda , and she looked up , surprised for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and left . He had spent the day tuning his truck 's engine , so when he turned the key , it started right up , and now he tried to take some satisfaction in that , sitting there , listening to how smooth it was . But even as he listened , he grew aware that he was paying attention to listening , not to the engine , so he pulled the truck around and headed back toward town . His own house , which he had built himself , of stone , and where he lived alone , was a mile in the other direction , but he was n't ready for that much quiet just yet , and he was n't sure what he did want . For a long minute at the four-way stop he considered turning down East Main and seeing if Maude was home . It was still early , maybe eight o'clock . The night of the tornado , night before last , she 'd called him into her house to take shelter from the rain , bullied and bossed him into her kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours . He 'd known who she was for years , but this was the first time he 'd talked to her , and when he left , she 'd offered to lend him her umbrella . If he 'd taken it-well , then he could have returned it , and she 'd ask about the boy , and he could say this and that . And then ? He remembered her strong , laughing face there in the candlelight in the middle of the night : the electricity out , she in her bathrobe and he in his socks . They 'd talked and had a good time . No foolishness about Maude Nash , candlelight or not . He smiled . " Smart woman , " he said aloud . She had a funny way of tilting her head when she was listening , and the candlelight had shown the white in her dark hair , had softened the small scar that split one eyebrow and made her look critical in the daylight . All those requirements for romance had been satisfied , and what he 'd felt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So he had n't taken the umbrella , and he knew why , and she knew why . So he did n't have it to return , and that was that . He turned east anyway , and saw that the lights were out in her house , and then he turned his truck around at the high school and drove past Nobel Aldrich 's house , where Aldrich 's car was in the driveway and the lights were on , upstairs and down . Man 's got sense , Byron thought . The night before , he and Nobel had been one of the search teams assigned to Clayborne Woods , the team that took the old logging road in , the team that found the boy and walked him out of the woods . Nobel had seen what Byron saw , and had had the sense to stay home tonight . Meaning I do n't , he thought then . Celebrating , for crying out loud ( he was thinking now of all the men at the Rainbow ) . And why not : a five-year-old child had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a search ; they 'd found the kid and he was fine . Why not celebrate ? Because . If Kyle had been a normal little kid and they 'd found him crying , if he or Nobel had picked him up and said , " Hey there , little fellow , it 's okay . Let 's go find your momma , okay ? " and held a bandanna so he could blow his nose , all right : go ahead and celebrate . The other fellows probably did n't see the difference , and no reason why they should . But he and Nobel Aldrich had been there , and that 's why he was n't celebrating , and why he felt a little ashamed that he 'd gone to the Rainbow in the first place , and admired Nobel Aldrich for staying home . It was a mild night for September , moonlit , as the previous night had been , the night of the search . When he got home , his barren Holstein cow stood near the board fence , one hind leg delicately bent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to scratch the white center of her broad , hard forehead , taking in the good , deep , familiar smell of hay , manure , and cow . " Might as well tell you , " he said , grinning to think what Maude would say about that , but then something like the upward swoop of being in love scooped into his stomach and throat , and for a second he thought he was going to cry . He stroked the cow 's black ear , running it through his fisted hand , feeling how warm and thick and tough it was , the coarse hairs distinct against his palm , and she did n't shake him off . The moonlight lay on the roof of the shed . " I guess all I was ready for was not to find him , " he said . " I probably expected we 'd hear the signal that somebody else had . Or that nobody would , and the search would get to be one of those long , ugly ones , and next spring his body would show up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there like that with that dummy . " He rubbed his thumb against the grain of the soft inside hairs of the cow 's ear , smoothed them , and then let the ear slide free . He leaned his forearms on the fence and clasped his hands loosely together . " So it made me feel strange . Right then , and it just keeps on . I 've been trying to figure out what he was thinking . I do n't know anything else to do about it . Probably the smart thing to do is talk to Nobel , see what his read on it was , a man with kids of his own and all . " He shrugged , looking past the cow 's bony back . " Seems stupid , though . Do n't know why , but it does . " He sighed , opened his hands , and looked at his palms . " You take this boy , deaf and dumb since he was born , and here he is , four miles from home in the woods , lost , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dummy . What does he think it is ? Ventriloquists . They pretend they 're not talking , make you believe the dummy 's talking . He ca n't talk , ca n't hear . What does he think-it 's just a doll or something ? " He stood up straight and looked the cow in the eye . " And he was n't playing , either . That 's the thing . " The cow switched her tail slowly and shifted her weight . " He was n't playing . I never saw anybody more serious than that boy was . " Byron rubbed his hand over his jaw while the moon hung steady and the cow stood still . " Here 's how I figure it , " he said . " Here 's what I think happened . " And then he was silent for a long minute , seeing in his mind how the boy and his mother would have been just sitting around in Ike 's yard , a nice day , sunshine , the boy probably with a toy truck , Louise having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody had just dropped off . " The boy , Kyle , he 's watching , curious , even though it 's the kind of stuff Ike does all the time-unpacking the junk people bring him , the leftovers of their yard sales , whatever . " Sure he 's curious . You 've got to think what the Trash and Treasure Trailer looks like to a kid . This fat old trailer just full of all that kind of junk Ike had . Old hats , a birdcage , trunks full of busted toys , rusty tools . " Byron smiled and leaned on the fence again , easy . " You know , one time when he was little , Will told me that when he grew up , Dad would grow down . " He smiled again , thinking of Will big and Dad little , of Will , his brother , when they 'd still been boys together . " Well , " he said softly . " Well , so kids figure things out the way it makes sense to them . And maybe it seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the trailer , get to keep all that stuff . Or maybe he had some money from birthdays or something , and he figured he could buy some of Ike 's stuff . " He sighed . " If he knows about buying . That 's the thingyou ca n't tell what he knows , how he figures things out . " Byron thought again of Kyle in the dark woods-when they turned the flashlights on him and he froze , and then stood up , not scrambling up like a scared kid but getting to his feet , almost like a man would . The cow sighed , her stomachs sounding . " Anyway . So Ike opens the box . It 's got some other junk in it-maybe old Christmas decorations , curtains-but then Ike lifts out this dummy . " Byron could see the dummy 's face as he had seen it in the woods , menacing and tragic , could smell the old wet leaves . He tried hard to imagine it in sunlight , as Kyle would have seen it , with his mother nearby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was for . " It 's a boy , wearing a brown tweed jacket and brown trousers , and it 's almost as big as Kyle . Ike holds it up , and its arms and legs dangle down , and he gives it a little shake . He says , Look at this , " and Louise looks and she says she hates it-'I hate those things , " she says . They 're weird . " " Ike says it 's a collector 's item . That 's how Ike is . He 'd say that . He 'd say , It looks a little like that what 's his name -Charlie McCarthy . " And Louise would n't buy that . Charlie McCarthy wore a top hat . This one 's ugly , and it 's got a smart-aleck face , and its hair 's all ratty . But Ike puts his hand into the hole in the dummy 's back and makes it blink . " And the kid does n't know what they 're saying , but he 's watching now . Ike makes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he screws his face all up and says , Hey there , kid-what you lookin " at ? " " Louise says Do n't , " but it 's too late-Ike makes the dummy wink at Kyle . It 's too late . Ike makes the dummy look back at Louise , makes it say , " Whatza matter , ladyyou do n't like dummies ? " and Louise says , Do n't use that word , " and Ike goes red , because he did n't mean anything , and he says , No offense , " and he takes his hand out and puts the thing down on the grass . And it lies there for the rest of the afternoon , while they unpack the other boxes and have another glass of tea . " Maybe they notice how the boy lies there near it ; maybe they do n't . Maybe they should have known right off when he disappeared that he 'd gone after it , but they 're not really paying attention , maybe . It 's got to be easy to ignore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't hear when you talk to him . " The cow shook her head , began to chew , and stepped closer to the fence . " I do n't know-Louise loves him , no doubt there , and she 's a good mother . Maybe she did notice , and then the tornado just shook everything up so it slipped her mind . So when he came up missing , she thought he 'd been stolen . " In a way , I guess , he had been . Lying there on the hot grass , watching that dummy lying there on the hot grass . " Byron stroked the cow 's dusty neck absently , seeing in his mind the oddly rough skin of the dummy 's face , the heavily painted eyebrows , the full smirking lips , how the flashlight had picked up the shine of the paint and made the eyes glitter . " He knew the dummy was n't alive . I 'm sure about that . But there 's something about those things . He 'd probably be careful not to stare too hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . Maybe he felt kind of sorry for it . " He rubbed his palm over the bony top of the cow 's head . " Maybe one time his mother took her fingers and lifted the corners of his mouth to make him smile , and he kept his face like that , like the dummy 's was now , all the time they were in some place where he knew his mother wanted him to smile , and he remembered how sad he 'd been . So maybe he lay there on the grass and thought how he 'd like to push the dummy 's grin down , so the face could relax . " The cow lowered her head and stepped away from his hand . The moon had moved , and Byron was thinking about the time Mom had done that , had not said a word , just forced his mouth into a smirk , and he 'd kept it that way , all through the long afternoon of his sister Kate 's getting married . Damned if he knew why she had , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're right , " he said to the cow 's profile . " What the hell do I know what he thought ? I do n't even know what I think half the time . And here I am , talking to a cow-not much better off than him , am I ? " Byron dusted his palms against each other and put his hands in his pockets . " Talking to your cow , By , " he said , and tried to laugh , to dodge the return of that sad , sweet feeling . " What you need . . , " he said , and did n't bother to finish . He got into his truck again and headed back to the Rainbow . It would have to be emptied out by now , probably almost nine o'clock . Better than nothing , he thought ; and then , because he was a decent and honest man , he thought , No offense , for Brenda had always been as nice to him as she could be . As he drove , he thought , That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't stop imagining Kyle lying in bed in the dark , being little , thinking of how next time they went across the road to the trailer , he would find the dummy and refuse to be parted from it . He 'd hug it , hug that scratchy brown jacket , and the body would be against his , just sticks inside the clothes . That would give him a strange feeling in his stomach , but he would hold on . And when his mother carried him home , her throat moving with talk , he would bring the dummy with him . The boy imagining theft : While Ike was asleep , he could look both ways and go across the road and go into the trailer and find the dummy , take its odd body in his arms , and carry it home . It would n't be too heavy . And then he would have it in his room . And thinking of frightening his mother : He had seen Ike put his hand into the dummy 's back , and if he had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it worked . When he had figured it out , he would go into the room where his mother was sleeping and shake her by the shoulder , and when she opened her eyes , he would put the face of the dummy in front of her face and chop its toothy mouth open and shut and scare her . Then he felt very bad and frightened himself , because he knew how warm she smelled in the morning in her bed , and he imagined that when she got scared , she might cry ; she had cried once , and he had cried too . Now , alone in the bed , he shook his head . No , if he had that thing , he would n't scare her with it . She did n't like it , he knew that much . And she did like him . But none of that 's anything but me , Byron thought , and he did n't even put on his turn signal , because there were so many cars and pickups still in the Rainbow 's parking lot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's motor and trying not to think of Kyle thinking about the dummy 's head , the face . How that rough , shiny skin would feel to his tongue if he got a chance to lick it . How cool and hard the grinning cheek would be against his own . Byron said aloud , " Knock it off , " and wished that he had a radio in the truck . He drove past the feed store , past Poole 's Ford dealership with the plastic pennants , past the Mobil station and the dark doughnut shop , and on into the center of town , where Maude Nash was just locking the library and coming down the steps . He pulled over on the wrong side of the street and called softly to her , " Ride ? " And there she was , Maude , not startled or even answering , just coming around to the other side of the truck in an ordinary way , the truck 's headlights making the white flowers on her full skirt glow for a second as she passed . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking how strange it was that he was n't worried about whether she 'd have trouble with the high step into the cab-that he was n't worried about a thing . She slid her books onto the seat and climbed up and in , slamming the door with a strong pull . She had on lipstick and her hair was wavier , combed back more carefully , but her eyes were no different . They still looked right at him , and in the dim cab light the funny eyebrow asked only the gentlest , most patient question . " Nice night for walking , " she said , observed , greeted . And so , even though he could smell faint perfume and a slight nostalgic scent of the library , paste and paper and wood , he could say , as if they 'd been having easy conversations for years , " Like to show you something , if you 've got time . Out past-well , out past where Ike 's Trash and Treasure used to be . " She nodded , an ordinary nod , simple , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they were already on their way . " Where you found little Kyle , " she said . " Yes , " he said . He put the truck in gear and drove . After they 'd passed her house and the high school and the old depot , she said , " I 'd wondered about that , " but not in a way that needed an answer , so he drove on . The two miles from the edge of the village to the lights in Ike 's house were quiet except for the truck 's smooth engine and the tires on the asphalt . The moonlight showed up once the houses thinned out . " Looks funny without the trailer , " she said-and it did , Ike 's little house oddly naked to the road . The space in front of it , where the trailer had sat for twenty-some years until the tornado came and turned it inside out and upside down , looked too small for anything to have been there . Now only some chunks of twisted metal and some broken glass were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were gone . " It does , " Byron said . " Pretty lucky it missed both houses . " He slowed and put on his signal a quarter mile past Ike 's . " Little bumpy here , " he said , apologetically , and eased the truck off the shoulder and into Newton 's cornfield . The headlights showed the neat rows of cornstalk stubble angling off from the wagon track . Maude said , " I imagine the search would have been harder if it had happened before the corn was cut , " and Byron , who had n't thought of that , could see what she meant : acres and acres of corn whispering , taller than the men , dense , impossible to search . Just thinking of it , he felt again the small panic of the night before , when he and Nobel had started back with the boy between them and he had for an instant believed that they were headed wrong , that the trees should have thinned by now . A lot of luck in this whole thing , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he did n't . He shifted down into second , his headlights showing the trees a quarter mile ahead , and said nothing . He brought the truck to a stop ten feet from the first trees , shifted into neutral , put on the hand brake , and turned on his high beams . THE trees here were mostly young maples and skinny walnuts and wild crabapples . Behind them were older maples and a few dogwoods and oaks and hemlocksan ordinary woods , with a path in and some honeysuckle and probably poison ivy in the undergrowth . But things hung from the trees , things that had never hung from trees before . A bent black umbrella , its handle carved like a duck 's head . A limp embroidered felt sombrero , rinsed pink , and a huge green lampshade , one side caved in . A blue tablecloth draped like bunting from one tree to another , gold threads in it sparkling in the headlights . A white-plastic doll stroller , a dish drainer , a flowered bathrobe hung as neatly from a spruce branch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a throw pillow with its stuffing dangling like a cloud , a work boot , part of a fishing rod . And on the path itself a gray portable typewriter , driven half into the ground ; the top of a pressure cooker , its round gauge like a monocle ; silverware ; a glass doorknob ; the round wire cage from a Bingo set . All this in the moonlight , in the headlights . " Good God , " Maude said . It had been sundown by the time he and Nobel had reached here , and dusky among the trees . A trace of fog had risen along the ground , and they had both paused right there at the edge of the trees , touching their flashlights before they went in . First thing , he had stepped on a sodden stuffed animal and started back , feeling its softened shape as flesh under his foot . And then , seeing what it really was , a light-blue bear or dog with a limp ribbon around its neck , he 'd gone on two or three steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Have to watch our step in here , " and turned on his flashlight , even though it was plenty light enough to see , if they paid attention . They 'd gone in along the trail maybe half a mile before the things the tornado had flung out of the Treasure Trailer began to thin out , began to be only a rag here and there , a baseball cap , a torn paper fan . " He followed the things , " Byron said . " Like they were a trail he was on . Clues . " That was n't at all what he had meant to say , and for the first time since he had pulled over by the library , he was uneasy . What was he doing , anyway ? Farther down the path , he knew , lay marbles and the broken wooden cigar box they must have been in , a swollen book of piano music , a plaid sneaker . Off to the right , somewhere in the undergrowth , where he had kicked it in a reflex of fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Like Hansel and Gretel , " quietly , the shock gone out of her voice , and Byron said , " Yes-like that . Hunting that dummy . " " Dummy ? " As they watched , the truck 's motor humming , a broken gilt picture frame slid from a high place in a hemlock and hit the ground , separating into slats . " We did n't know about it when we were looking . It was an old ventriloquist 's dummy from the Trash and Treasure , blown out with everything else . He was looking for it . Nobel Aldrich and I went in along this trail about two miles , slow and quiet , listening for him , looking with our flashlights . Then we decided to come back-to spread out to either side of the trail about ten or twelve yards and come back that way . " That far in , the ground fog had been gone , and Byron had kept feeling that wet dog or whatever it was he 'd stepped on , the weird weakening of his leg muscles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the real snake that the bicycle tire had n't been . It had been so quiet that he wondered now if he 'd been thinking anything at all . He 'd listened to the noise he made and the noise Nobel made , invisible twenty-five yards away except for the flashlight now and then . " We were walking along as quiet as we could in there , trying to listen for him if he was crying or walkingnot much else we could do , " Byron said . He could n't even begin to explain the kind of quiet it had been , as if the silence were a transparent absence , a clear waiting shape made by the crossings of branches and stems . Or what had happened in his throat and stomach when he heard the sound , how hard it had been to force his brain and then his mouth , tongue , throat , to call , " Nobel ? " Nobel had stopped , and the silence had been sharp-edged , like held breath , even after Nobel called back , " Yeah ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I heard this sound-this quiet little tup tup tup sound . Sort of wooden-sounding , not like a bird or an insect but steady , and then it would stop for a few seconds and start up again . " The headlights made the yellow glass eye in the umbrella handle gleam . " I looked over to the right and I saw something move and then I saw him sitting there by a big old maple with this ventriloquist 's dummy . " The boy had seemed to glow softly , his bare arms and legs , his blond head . All that paleness there in the dusk beside that dark old tree . He was sitting cross-legged , half toward the path , holding the dummy facing him , so that Byron had seen the dummy 's face before he saw the boy 's . The dummy 's eyes had glittered as its thick lips opened and no sound came out . Nobel had come up beside Byron then , his flashlight , like Byron 's , pointing down , as if they both knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was the strangest thing I ever saw . He had his hand in the back of the dummy , and what I 'd heard was the dummy 's mouth clopping shut-open , shut , open , shut . " Byron moved his hand , flat-fingered , to show how the mouth had gone , but it was wrong-it was the silhouette of a quacking duck , silly . He put his hand back on the steering wheel . " The boy was making the dummy move its mouth for a whilelike for a sentence , maybe-and then he moved his mouth the same way . " Something small and dark , mouse or mole , rolled like a dustball across the path . " Up and down , up and down . " How empty the boy had made his face to get his jaw to move that way . Maude drew in a breath and let it out without saying anything , and Byron could n't tell whether he was glad or not that she had n't spoken . But he knew that the ease he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen and deciding he 'd had too good a time to spoil it by making suggestions , and watching her deciding the same thing-that ease was gone . To keep the sad lonesomeness of knowing that from filling him up , he started talking again , saying random things , looking at the junk hanging in the trees and sparkling on the path . " I never knew Louise to speak of . Knew her dad some years ago , but I did n't know she was back in town . Ike said they 'd been out looking for an hour , and she just kept calling and calling , like the boy could hear her . Ike was out of patience , I think , but I bet if he 'd been looking alone he 'd have been calling too . You feel stupid not calling-have to make yourself not do it . " He could feel Maude looking at him now , watching his face by the dim dashboard light , but he kept his eyes on the round gleam of the pressure-cooker gauge and his hands on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and no way Louise could explain it to him , make him understand why all of a sudden they 're sitting down in the basement and it 's dark at suppertime . Supper 's on the table , and they 're sitting on the basement floor . He ca n't hear the wind . I do n't know , maybe she 's got some way of talking to him . He 's five , got to have figured something out by now-maybe he knows about storms from the vibrations . Maybe when the tornado went over and picked that trailer up and threw it , he knew exactly what was going on . Maybe he knows people talk and hear and he does n't , but I keep thinking about it , and I ca n't make it make sense . It 's like one of us suspected that other people could do something with their knees that meant something , or their elbows , that we could n't do and could n't even imagine- " Maude laughed then-not her big roaring laugh , that he 'd heard at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skinny wife , but a gentle little laugh . " Sorry , " she said , but she was smiling . " It just sounded funny . Talking with our elbows . " She looked back out , and now Byron watched her , seeing the delicate skin beside her eyes , the deep waves of her hair , the way her eyebrows moved when she talked . " You know , the first ventriloquists were fortune-tellers , " she said . " Prophets . Probably Moses was a ventriloquist-the burning bush and all that . " She glanced at him and then away , and in Byron 's chest the loop of sadness turned and sprang , arched near his throat . TWO nights ago , in her kitchen , a moment had come , a little past midnight , when they 'd looked at each other , clear and simple , and seen that they were n't in love . They had n't said it , but that 's what it was , and so she 'd offered her umbrella , and he 'd said thank you , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long breath , looked out at the spangled blue cloth in the trees , and said the one thing he had n't thought . " I think he was in love with it , " he said . Out of the corner of his eye he saw her hand lift itself from her lap in a little flutter , not even close to high enough to touch her throat . But that 's the gesture it was , stopped , held down . But all she said was " So . When you found him . . . , " which brought back the boy and the heavy-lidded eyes of the dummy , the pale yellow of the flashlight beam . And Byron said , " It was just so private . But he- " Then he had to stop , had to put both his hands over his eyes and smooth his face , down and out , feeling the roughness of his fingertips on his eyelids , his palms on his cheeks , the day 's stubble against his palms . He and Nobel had both kept their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they could see the boy 's face before they approached . Five years old . The sweetest mouth , that fragile neck , and the way he looked into that dummy 's eyes . The way he was waiting . " I do n't know how to describe it , " he said . " For just a couple of seconds I got to see him working at it-looking into that dummy 's eyes and moving his mouth . Not like he was saying words . Just open and shut , just like the dummy 's mouth did . Open and shut . And then he saw my light and he stopped . But he kept on looking into those eyes for a second . And I do n't have any idea what he was thinking . " He ran his palms along the steering wheel . " None of my business . " He turned his hands over and looked at his palms , the darkness of the palms , the calluses . " I guess some things you ca n't explain , " he said . Byron waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet . Say it , he thought , but gently , as gentle and wishful as he imagined his hand on her hair would be if he allowed it to reach for her . He knew that if he did , if he touched her , the thing she would say would not be , could not be , the thing he was waiting for her to say , which could not be a thing he drew from her , with even the gentlest touch . Maude did n't say anything . The moon went on shining , the junk in the trees hung there , and Byron thought of how the moonlight made the white splotches on his cow 's back glow , and of how simply cheerful all those men in the Rainbow had seemed . So Byron Doatze shifted slowly into reverse and half turned toward her so that he could see out the back window . He met her eyes , and saw how sad and steady they were , and how set her mouth was , the strong line of her jaw . He kept one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the seat , and he said , " He stood up like a man would . He still had his hand in the back of the dummy , and then he pulled his hand out , so gently , and held the dummy out to me . " She nodded then , and he saw her mouth soften , and to keep from doing anything else , to keep from having to decide what that meant , he looked behind the truck and started backing up , his eyes on the wagon track that was washed red by his backup lights . They rode the two miles to the edge of town in the silence of the truck 's tires and the truck 's motor and the knowledge of breathing . As they passed the first houses , Byron tried to remember if he 'd held the boy 's hand or not . But even as he was thinking it , he knew he was wondering about it so that he would n't be waiting to hear what she said , wondering if she 'd say anything at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she cleared her throat quietly and said , " You should have been honored . " For just a second a smoothness appeared in Byron 's mind , a simple smooth area , and then he said , " Yes . I guess I should have been . But I was n't . I gave it to Nobel , and he carried it back . " The words came out easy and surprised in spite of how the thing he could only call his heart rose up almost to his throat , so full and grateful that it should have choked him . She did n't say anything else , and neither did he . He was waiting again now , but for something-for what it would be , not if it would be . So when he had pulled on the brake , and she had opened the door , and she reached to gather her books from the seat between them , Byron took her wrist gently and raised her hand and kissed her palm as if it was a thing that could be done , knowing the scent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let her warm wrist slide free of his loose grasp . As if it was possible , she touched his face , her cool fingers briefly across his cheek , beside his eye , and then carefully , delicately , across his lips . Neither of them said anything else , not even good night , as she stepped down from the truck , but he watched her walk to her door , the moonlight picking out those flowers on her full skirt , and when she paused there , and then turned and raised her hand , he raised his too , and then he waited while she went in , waited until he saw her kitchen light come on , before he drove on home , not even thinking , not even hearing himself whistling softly over the steady hum of his engine . 
##1003686 ARMENIAN FROSTBITE JOURNAL : Remembering the Winter of 1992-93 <p> Exchanging post hardship stories with my wife 's diplomatic colleagues sometimes reminds me of a sketch in which two crusty Scotsmen were arguing over which of them had experienced the harsher upbringing . <p> " Why , we licked the pavement for breakfast , " the first proclaimed in a thick burr . " Luxury ! " sniffed the second . <p> Risking similar one-upmanship , I , nevertheless , present this account , with apologies to Mark Twain , of the coldest winter I ever spent on an Arctic expedition - the winter I spent living in an apartment in Yerevan , Armenia . Of course , many other experiences in Armenia etched themselves in my memory just as clearly as that frigid season . <p> On the night of March 11 , 1992 I arrived in Yerevan with my wife Rosemarie , the first foreign service officer permanently assigned to our new U.S. embassy there . Later that evening we were escorted into our temporary living quarters , an icy room in the Hotel Armenia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The floor matron glided in with a candle-lit tray of tea as two electrical engineers crisscrossed the room examining the outlets by the glow of their cigarette lighters . Suddenly , as if to demonstrate that the room was not totally devoid of amenities , a torrent of water gushed out of the middle of the ceiling , sending Rosemarie , curled up in her clothes and covers in the bed , into a fit of laughter so hysterical it raised the final few reclining hairs on the back of my neck . <p> The buoyant spirit of the Armenian people was on display Friday nights at the Yerevan Opera House . Every week the Armenian Philharmonic Orchestra delivered a moving performance in an often freezing hall . The audience regularly remained in their coats during the concerts while the musicians , clad in elegant tuxedos and gowns and seemingly oblivious to the extreme temperatures , played with a precision and fervor belying the circumstances . <p> Sitting in the presidential box at our initial concert , we were introduced by the maestro to a wildly applauding crowd . Amid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a craggy , gray-haired gentleman in a shearling coat angrily shaking his fist in my direction . Willing , seconds before , to take credit for any and all positive feelings toward the United States , I sat back down , startled and offended that the man 's apparent rage should be directed toward me , an innocent bystander . <p> I wondered how safe I was in such an auditorium . Was n't there a Hitchcock movie something like this ? I imagined a curtain being pushed aside by a hand with a luger in it . With my eyes on the cymbalist I listened nervously as the music built to a crescendo , but the piece finished uneventfully and intermission arrived . <p> We moved through the crowd , shaking hands and talking with the people . In the reception room we continued to soak up kind words of welcome . Out of the corner of my eye I noticed the man in the shearling coat working his way toward us . He stopped with his face inches from mine . <p> " What are you going to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me for the diplomat in the family . <p> " I 'm going to stay away from it , " I said , " I understand they 're fighting a war there . " He stepped back with his mouth ajar . I referred the question to my wife , luckily by my side , who answered him a bit more substantively and with considerably more tact . He eyed me suspiciously as he listened , shaking his head , then faded back into the crowd . <p> We visited Gyumri , still virtually in ruins from the devastating 1988 earth-quake , to commemorate the beginning of the rebuilding of the city 's concert hall . Despite a blustery day the entire population of the city seemed to have turned out for the dedication . <p> The instruments of the musicians who had perished inside the former hall were welded together in a monument next to the building . Attempting to lay a wreath at its base , my wife sank up to her ankles in the cold mud , prompting a nice woman in the crowd to reach into her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hand-knit socks . The entire scenario was captured by a TV news crew , turning Rosemarie into a minor celebrity at our Yerevan hotel the next day . <p> The Armenians seldom lost their sense of humor . During our hotel stay our maid recognized the voice of one of her co-workers yelling up from one of the frequently stalled elevators several floors below . " Lisa ? " she shouted back down to her in what I was certain was the initial stage of a heroic rescue . " Yes , " came the hopeful reply . Our maid cupped her hands around her mouth and , bending forward in the direction of the stalled car , laughed at the top of her lungs . <p> Armenia is a starkly picturesque country filled with ancient churches and ruins , some set against colorful broad vistas in the Caucasus range . On clear days in Yerevan snowcapped Mount Ararat would loom up on the horizon like a beautiful hologram . By night an overcrowded streetcar clicked and rumbled up a nearby hill , sparks showering down from its overhead power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unfortunately the springtime night air was also frequently filled with the sound of automatic weapons as criminal groups carried out bloody vendettas against one another in the lobby of a neighboring hotel and opposition groups sprayed gunfire along the back perimeter of a government compound on the Hrazdan River . At an informal gathering I asked an Armenian official about the source of all the shooting . He looked me in the eye and in the sincerest of tones said , I think those are picnickers . " <p> By summer we had moved into a spacious apartment at the foot of Bagramian Avenue . Warm , sunny weather had arrived , noticeably lifting spirits . One weekend we were returning from a sight-seeing trip to the remote fortress and church of Amberd . Winding down a steep mountain road that was a series of switch-backs with sheer drop-offs on both sides , our driver 's labored breathing alerted me to the fact that he was pumping the brakes to the floor and trying to pull back on the already fully-extended emergency brake , both actions without effect . He leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks , onto what little shoulder there was on the opposite side of the down-grade , then back onto the road , picking up speed . <p> He kept hurriedly crossing himself , either in thanks for the previous curve or in preparation for the next . Five tire-screeching switchbacks later we were flying down a relatively flat stretch of straight pavement at the base of the mountain . I think it will be okay from here on , " he asserted once the Volga had finally come to a stop . We piled out and , with less difficulty than I would have imagined , hitch-hiked back to Yerevan . <p> The next month our embassy consular officer and I went on another journey , billed in advance as a fishing trip . As we loaded our stuff into the back of the white Neva that had come to pick us up early on Saturday morning , I noticed we were the only ones who had brought fishing equipment and the only ones not carrying sidearms . Although it was a warm July day , the driver , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face , wore racing gloves . He was introduced to us as a surgeon . I hoped I was n't going to require surgery before the day was over . <p> Sixteen hours later we were dropped off where we had been picked up , having enjoyed the fishing excursion turned road trip . We had been near the water only once , for about fifteen seconds , only to hear an extreme version of that old hard luck story " you should have been here last week , they were really biting . " In this case one of our hosts turned to us at streamside as the third of four outdoor banquets was being set up in the distance and said , " Twenty years ago this water had fish in it . " <p> The day was one incredible feast after another - a dizzying assortment of food and drink interrupted only by travel to the next site and the occasional stop alongside the road for target practice . The Macharov handgun , I can say now from experience , has a remarkably smooth action . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the road . Our driver 's gloves were no affectation . He negotiated the rutted , serpentine mountain passes like a veteran of the Pike 's Peak Hill Climb and the Baja 2000 . An avid conversationalist and ever the gentleman , he insisted on maintaining eye contact with us , his main interlocutors , even though we were riding in the backseat . During one particularly breath-taking moment he looked back at us as we sped along a dirt ridge with mountains rising immediately to the left and a riverbed a mile below us to the right . After pausing for dramatic effect , he said , " Up here you 'll see a monument to the school bus that went off the cliff , " turning back toward the road just in time to put the vehicle into an expertly controlled four-wheel drift around a fallen boulder the size of a two-car garage . <p> I experienced similar thrills flying in and out of Yerevan on trips to our embassy in Moscow . Before the imposition of free market prices , the flights tended to be overbooked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight out of a war zone . When the heated discussions over who owned what seat had died down , the aisles were crammed with musical-chair losers , sitting on their luggage or stoically standing for the duration of the flight . <p> Many seemed obsessed with being the first ones off the plane although the flights were usually running days behind schedule . On a flight from Moscow a stewardess announced over the intercom that we would be landing in twenty minutes . Seventy-five percent of the passengers promptly stood up , put on their coats , pulled their luggage down from the overhead , and lined up in the aisles with the plane still at 20,000 feet . That was n't enough advanced preparation for some , however , who pushed to the front , opened the stairwell hatch to the luggage compartment and exit door in the belly of the plane , and filed down -- apparently intent on riding the landing gear down onto the runway . <p> The deep-seated economic and social problems in Armenia had many causes , including the blockade due to the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its trading systems , the lingering effects of the 1988 earthquake , and Armenia 's centuries-old predicament - an island of Christianity surrounded by Muslims and strife-tom neighbors . In late 1992 , already reeling under those conditions , the country was unknowingly on the brink of their coldest winter in more than forty years , when their only remaining energy source , the gas pipeline through Georgia was blown up , plunging them into a pitch-black deep-freeze straight out of the middle ages . <p> In a city of more than a million people the nights were now so completely dark and eerily silent that pedestrians suddenly emerged from the gloom and immediately disappeared back into it like shambling zombies in a bad horror movie . And the cold was one I 'd never experienced growing up in Wisconsin and Chicago : it was continuous and without relief . <p> There was no going inside to warm up ; it often felt colder in our meatlocker of an apartment than on the frozen streets . <p> Early in the winter we could still sleep in one of the bedrooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and boots and piling on so many blankets that I occasionally woke up thinking that a mini-van had parked on my chest . Once it became too cold to do that , we slept on the kitchen floor in front of an open fireplace . Sometimes the unseasoned wood popped and exploded , sending glowing embers everywhere . I would brush them from my sleeping wife 's hair and the blankets and wait for the fire to die down before drifting off . <p> I did discover a use for those otherwise annoying blow-in cards that fall like rain from many of today 's magazines . Sitting close to the fire , I would flip one in , lean forward , and read half a page as it flared up . <p> For most of the winter we received an average of one or two hours of electricity per day , prompting what we called " The Yerevan Firedrill . " We left the lights in the kitchen in the on position so that if the current came on in the middle of the night we could wake up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough warm water for sponge baths from the hot plates set up throughout the apartment , and fine-tuning the electrical flow until the circuit breaker would stay on . <p> Because the water supply was sporadic , the bathtub functioned as an all purpose reservoir , filled up whenever water was available then drawn upon as needed for drinking , cooking , washing , and flushing . Before running water into the tub of his shadowy apartment one night , one of the embassy 's political officers removed what he assumed was a loofa sponge left by the previous tenant , only to hold it up to a candle and find a frozen rat . <p> It was difficult to convey the quality of such a life . I 'll always remember my brother asking , " If you do n't have electricity , does n't your food spoil ? " <p> ' Not unless we put it in the refrigerator and shut the door , " I told him . <p> One day in the middle of January I squeezed into a crowded cafe illuminated by a single shaft of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . Each diner was in full outdoor attire and huddled over a bowl of soup so hot in comparison to the room temperature that clouds of steam rose everywhere in the muted light . Every seat was taken , but no one said a word - the room was a symphony of slurping and sniffling . As soon as my soup arrived , I eagerly joined the chorus . <p> Of course whatever discomfort we Americans endured was minor compared to that of most of the population . Having enjoyed a comparatively high standard of living among the Soviet republics , the newly-independent Armenians found themselves in a precipitous downward-spiral punctuated with nightmare visions : a totally blacked-out capital of overnight breadlines , roving packs of starving dogs attacking people , and a proliferation of stumps along avenues once lined by full-grown trees . <p> I look back on those strange days with mixed feelings . My wife and her coworkers got our new embassy up and running in a troubled land under extremely difficult conditions . I wrote subsequently published fiction , non-fiction , and a government guidebook for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a blend of the two . The Armenian people , despite their plight , always went out of their way to offer hospitality , genuine friendship , and a helping hand . Although working and living conditions have improved for American embassy employees since those early days and Armenia has made significant democratic and economic progress , life for the Armenians continues to be an upward struggle . <p> Photo ( Lee and Rosemarie Forsythe ) <p> 
##1003687 Summer 's Full <p> The image of Acropolis bright white against the Mediterranean sky , stuck in my mind for months prior to the trip . I was 15-and-a-half years old and longing to experience " life " and love outside my little hometown . I tingled with the sense that this first Journey abroad to the ancient world was a Journey to the future . Among the old stones and Greek streets , amidst a landscape unlike the verdant green of my rural Connecticut world , I was certain to breathe in the first air of adulthood and find adventure , independence , and , I most fervently hoped , the sweetness of romance . <p> The actuality of the journey matched my expectations , and I remained a-tingle for six glorious weeks . I boldly combed the streets of Athens , bargained with shopkeepers for flokati rugs and cheap silver bracelets and rings , and ordered baklava and kataifi at the coffeehouses on Syntagma Square . No taste , sight , sound , or smell seemed insignificant . Even the masses of dark cherries , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on beds of ice in the covered market near Omonia Square alerted me that I would never again be quite the same . <p> But although Athens romanced me , the boys in my study tour did not , and as our tour came to an end , I accepted , not without a few sighs , that I would return home disappointed in that regard . <p> On our final weekend , we were driven out into the Peloponnese to the ancient amphitheater at Epidaurus to see a performance of Lysistrata . The day had been brilliantly hot as we tramped about the ruins of nearby Corinth . In the early evening , the coolness of the old gray stones of the theater came as a welcome relief . But as the stars of this clear night made their appearance , the temperature dropped , and those of us high up in the amphitheater began to shiver . The cold of the great blocks of granite passed through my thin cotton dress . <p> Although I understood none of the language of the play , the spectacle before me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actors , the sporadic breaking out of laughter among the audience , the stars . But gradually another element came to my attention . I had been first down the row of stone , counting off the seat numbers assigned to us . I did not much heed the noisy group of Greek teenaged boys to my left . But as the evening became chillier , I realized the space between me and the young Greek to my left had shrunk until we were nearly touching . Whether his movements were deliberate or simply warmth-seeking instinct I do not know . But , first our arms brushed and then they were gently pressed against one another , mine bare and pale and goose-pimply , his smooth and brown and warm . We looked straight ahead and sat very still for a long time ; lulled by his warmth . I could not move and did not wish to . <p> Intermission did not break the spell . We remained close together , although barely touching . I heard , finally , his voice , at once pleasant and exotic , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I liked how it sounded , male tinged with the sweetness of adolescence . I was glad none of my comrades talked much to me , so that I might continue to listen and have no need to move away from him . <p> When the performance resumed , I felt once more to be the sole object of his attention , as he was of mine . Inevitably , our bodies shifted even closer together , now touching hips , thighs , calves . We sat shoe to shoe . I had long since stopped trying to see him through the corner of my eye -- it hurt . <p> My left hand had been resting in my lap entwined with the right . I disengaged them at one point , allowing the left to lie on my thigh . A moment later , it was encased in his own . We held hands all too briefly , for hardly five minutes passed before the play ended . The spotlights obliterated the stars , and we had to rise among the tide of people returning to reality . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faced one another for a second or two . He smiled shyly . We turned in opposite directions and so left the theater , I having found at last a bit of Greek romance to take home . <p> Article copyright Maiden Voyages . <p> Article copyright Maiden Voyages . <p>

##1003692 MY fat , MY buSiNeSS ! <p> I 'm on the run to the subway . Great day . Feeling good . I dash into a nearby deli and search for the perfect muffin to match my mood . From over my shoulder a strange voice mutters , " Hey , better watch the bread . " I look over to find an elderly man eyeing me disapprovingly . Good mood gone , I drop the muffin in its bin and slouch out of the store . How could I be such a pig ? <p> Let me paint the picture . I am no walking blimp -- hell , not even close . Believe it or not , I am considered by some to be reasonably attractive . But my figure , at 5 ' 5 " and 180 pounds ( without shoes or a big breakfast ) , invites a range of insulting remarks from every would-be dietitian around . <p> Given the comments many feel free to make , women of all sizes can be hard-pressed to maintain a normal blood pressure level while walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shapely , passersby also throw me such lively remarks as " Watch out , big lady " and " Ooooooh , mucho mama . " On one even more memorable occasion , my sister and I walked into a Baskin-Robbins in search of a diet Coke -- which , it turned out , they did not sell . As we were leaving I remarked , " Oh , I 'm so disappointed . " Without a pause , a twentysomething male customer responded , " Why ? They do n't sell chocolate by the gallon ? " <p> Even acquaintances can be guilty : Once , when I rejected a suitor , I was very sincerely told that he understood if I would rather " see someone my own size . " ( Actually , I told him , I was looking for a man with a comparable IQ . ) <p> There is also the insult disguised as " being helpful " -- spoken by those who genuinely believe that they have my best interests in mind . A casual acquaintance once chastised my choice of a slice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started on the tsk-tsks I receive from strangers while consuming , oh , just about anything but plain lettuce . <p> What gives ? Why are these folks taking notes on what I eat ? If I choose to have a muffin or a slice of pizza , does it ever occur to them that I might have worked it into my diet ? I doubt it . It 's as if they think their warnings to " watch the bread " will cause me to look down , notice my hips and exclaim , " Oh my God , you 're right -- I 'm fat ! Excuse me while I go page Jenny Craig . " <p> Now , I will not pretend to be one of those chunky people who think they look just fine the way they are , thank you , and please pass the M &Ms.; My weight interferes with my self-confidence and my career as a musical-theater performer . But I 'm dealing with it myself . The way others deal with baldness . Would the stranger who told me to watch the bread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better try Rogaine ? <p> You might assume that I have developed a smart-ass comeback for the diet police . Stupidly enough , I just walk away feeling guilty . Sometimes I find myself prefacing every public food selection with an elaborate description of what I have eaten that day and how many fat grams it contained . Sometimes I hide the frozen yogurt under the pita bread and tuna fish while I shop . I know I owe my critics nothing , but I have to admit -- the criticism gets to me . <p> It should n't . While these members of the food Gestapo are busy commenting on my size 16 to 18 self and my piece of pizza , do they know or care that a couple of years ago I was squeezing into size 26 ? <p> They have no idea whether what I weighed this morning was more or less than the day before . My life history is not printed on my backside . All they know is that they see a somewhat-overweight person walking into a David 's Cookies . <p> So all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But you have such a pretty face " observation , implying that I 'm wasting what beauty I have , insinuates that I should feel ashamed of my size . Well , it 's high time for you to feel ashamed . The next time you feel that remark about to escape your lips , take a minute to think . Why are you so threatened ? Do you think fat is catching ? Your thighs wo n't inflate just because they brush against mine . You wo n't need to Versa Climb if I choose to eat Chinese . <p> Butting into my eating habits does n't make you helpful . In my book -- the one with the chocolate smudges -- you come off as insensitive and snobbish . <p> And that 's far less attractive than flabby thighs . <p> Article copyright Radiance . <p> Article copyright Radiance . <p>

##1003704 WHEN PAUL Bertram asked me in 1959 to stay on at Princeton as his graduate assistant , I felt as Walter Lippmann must have felt when , many decades earlier , he was asked a similar question by George Santayana at Harvard . Lippmann turned down the job-as the most promising young man in America , he did n't need it-and I sometimes wish I had done the same . My six-year involvement with Paul-I only came to call him by his first name in the last two years of his life-was to leave such lasting effects that I have often wondered , in the way ( I suppose ) of a man who marries young and starts a family , what things would have been like had I remained clear of any relationship with Paul and Julia Bertram . Yet my life is all but unimaginable without them . I say " them " because people tended to think of the childless Bertrams more as a couple than as two distinct individuals . In some very loose sense-in some vulgar sense , Paul would no doubt have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul , the more talented of the two , cast in the role of Virginia . He was also like Virginia in seeming the more sensitive , the more vulnerable . But they were indubitably a pair , if not quite , as I was to discover , a team . In conversation , they were never Paul Bertram and his wife , or Paul and Mrs. Bertram . One spoke of inviting the Bertrams , or one wondered what the Bertrams would think of something or other , or one would drop their names as a single unit : " Yes , last night at Morris Bishop 's I finally met the Bertrams . " Julia , who wrote short stories and what is called cultural criticism , seemed habituated in print to using the first-person plural , so much so that a clever journalist , considering something she had recently written , once asked , " Who is ' we ' ? " But everyone knew who we was-we was the Bertrams . <p> Paul Bertram was of course the famous critic and the author of that exquisite single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W H. Auden had extravagantly called " perhaps the only volume of poetry produced in the 20th century likely to be read well into the 21st . " When I decided on teaching as a career , I remember Paul saying to me that Shaw had got it wrong when he observed that those who can not do , teach . " The way it should really run , " he said , " is that those who can not accept less in life than true greatness have no place to turn but teaching . " I always took this to mean that Paul had once touched the stars and knew he would never do so again , and so had resigned himself to a life of criticism and teaching . <p> How else explain a man who had written 29 perfect poems but who never afterward continued in the line of his genius ? It would , I thought , be very much like Paul to accept his own limitations , in art as elsewhere . If a single word described his manner , character , even style , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life had dealt him , to life as it was , to the brevity of his time on earth , to the distinct possibility of oblivion at the end of a dependably less than smooth road . I knew that Paul , many years earlier , had had a long psychoanalysis . He was still a Freudian in the larger , philosophical sense-a Civilization and Its Discontents Freudian . In Paul , though , the accent was quite as much on the civilization as on the discontents ; or , to put it somewhat differently , he made the discontents seem worth putting up with , if only one could attain civilization of his deeply admirable kind . <p> FIRST ENCOUNTERED Paul when I walked into his senior seminar on Keats . Like every undergraduate at Princeton studying English , I had heard of him . Along with the volume of poems , he had written three books of critical essays , each of which had helped to define the period in which it was written : the fatal utopianism of our revolutionary 30 's , the callowness of our liberalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . As a critic of culture , Paul 's task seemed to be to tell us that we had n't grasped life 's essential lessons , at least not with anything like the complexity of response they required . <p> A small man , with gray hair combed straight back , green eyes with dark pouches , dressed always in a beautifully cut , dark gray suit with a white button-down shirt and a black knit tie and plain-toed black shoes , Paul Bertram seemed less academic than other teachers I had come across at Princeton . He looked as though he could have succeeded outside a university setting : as a subtle judge , an eye surgeon , an architect working with the entire history of European culture under his belt . <p> That first day of class Professor Bertram slipped into the classroom at Pyme Hall , wrote his name and the course number on the board , took a seat at the head of the table , withdrew from his shirt pocket a periwinkle blue packet of Gauloise cigarettes and from his suit-coat pocket a small gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have never seen anyone smoke quite the way Paul Bertram did . He inhaled deeply , as if the cigarette were connected to an oxygen tank he required to stay alive ; removing the short French cigarette from his mouth , he slowly , very slowly , released a quantity of smoke so vast as to make our classroom seem a back room in war-torn Europe where matters of life and death were being discussed and absolutely no small talk was allowed . <p> He began : " A man of twenty-five , of stunted growth , a physician by training , lies in a bed in a dampish room in Rome . He is dying of tuberculosis , then known as consumption , and he is aware of it . He also knows that he has written a number of poems that have a distinct chance of living forever . He ponders his fate . Was it worth it ? Was it a fair bargain ? Would you agree to it : to have your name live forever through your work when you yourself will be jerked abruptly from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Here Bertram , exhaling , released yet another immensity of smoke . " Well , " he asked , " would you ? " <p> He went around the room , asking each of the eleven of us , all males of twenty-one , if we would accept the bargain that had been given to John Keats without his ever really having consented to it . Allowing for variations in articulateness , everyone in the class answered the question in the same way . Forty or 50 fewer years of life in return for eternal fame ? None of my classmates had the slightest hesitation or doubt . <p> I was the lone dissenter . I remember saying , more emphatically than I generally spoke in any classroom , that I thought it a very bad deal from start to finish . If , at the end of a reasonably long and rich life , I were to arrive in heaven , what difference would earthly fame , even eternal fame , make ? Arrival in hell would not change things . Nor would the bargain be any better if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Honor , yes ; but fame , I concluded , was not among the very limited number of things for which one ought to be ready to give up his life . <p> Professor Bertram timed yet another cloud of smoke to arise with my finish . " An unpredictable point of view , Mr. Hopkins , " he said , squinting . " I wo n't , just now , detain the class to ask what besides honor you would be ready to give up your life for . But some other time I just might . " <p> He never did , but , as I say , Paul was a subtle man , and I have no doubt he divined what was on my list , which has n't changed much since that afternoon in Princeton . It was an afternoon that transformed my life . I had always been a good student-at the top of my class at Dalton , at the top again at Groton , and near the top at Princeton . But I would work for Paul Bertram as I worked for no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he really did inspire me . I read everything I could about Keats : all the biographies , all the memoirs of his contemporaries , nearly all the criticism . I had the great poems by heart ; I came pretty near to memorizing the key letters . I yearned to excel in Paul Bertram 's eyes even more than I ever did in my father's-and I admired and loved my father without complication . <p> IF I YEARNED for Paul Bertram 's approval , he , I now understand , took me up in turn . He was not someone who wished for disciples ; his thought was not so clear-cut , so hard-edged , that disciples could hope to follow it-to become , in effect , Bertramists . The notion was absurd . The only way to do that was to become copiously cultivated . I 'm not sure what he saw in me , and I 've thought fairly long about it . Perhaps he felt that , having ignited the flame of intellectual passion , he should keep me in a state of permanent conflagration . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class or in his office , he never addressed me as other than Mr. Hopkins-Kenneth would come later . But I could sense that his expectations for me were higher than for my classmates ; and I saw it as my job not to disappoint him . I had grown up with my father 's lucid , lawyerly mind : a mind that could parse the cause-and-effect relations of an intricate problem , diagram it , and return it to you with its certain , settled solution . But so enraptured had I become by the very style of Paul Bertram 's thinking , which somehow tended to take things to a level above cause and effect , beyond right or wrong , to where the meaning of life itself seemed at stake , that I became intellectually drunk in his classes . I worried not at all about the reactions of my classmates , who must have despised me for making them seem shallow , but often these late afternoon classes in Pyme Hall came down to conversations between the two of us . The deep pleasure of it thrilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ semester-Paul invited me to his house for dinner . I was more than a little nervous . My awe for him had not abated ; familiarity only bred greater respect . And Julia Bertram , by reputation , was a different but no less formidable personage . Preparing for this dinner as I might for a final exam , I read every item in her slender output . I wondered what Bertram had told her about me , sensing that her standard could well be as severe as , if not more so than , her husband 's . <p> When Julia was young , I later learned , the critics Allen Tate and Richard Blackmur were both supposed to have proposed marriage to her . Unlike Paul , she was not Jewish , but came from a Boston family that had suffered an unredeemable setback during the Depression , thus putting an end to what must have seemed a promising musical career : she had begun life as a violin prodigy . JULIA BERTRAM greeted me at the door of a rather modest house on Hun Road . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bottle of wine I had brought and said , " Thank you , Mr. Hopkins . My husband is still upstairs . Let us have a glass of sherry before he joins us . " <p> She led me into a small living room , modestly furnished . Books and magazines were set out on a coffee table and on lamp tables . No bookcases were in sight ; Bertram 's study must have been upstairs . Moving aside copies of Poetry and Partisan Review , she set a not very appealing plate of crackers and cheddar cheese on the coffee table and handed me my glass . Although a slight woman , Julia Bertram had thick calves . Not a leg man , I thought irreverently to myself of my professor . <p> She sat across from me . " So tell me , " she said , " do you too love my husband ? " <p> " Sorry , " I said , " I do n't understand . " <p> " Do n't you ? Regrettable . Many of his students do , you know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom they long . " <p> " Actually , " I said , " I 'm not searching for a father . I have a quite good one at home in New York . " " Then what do you find appealing about him ? I assume there must be something or you would n't be here . " <p> " He 's taught me a way of thinking I had n't known before , " I said . " He has a handsome mind . " " An interesting notion , " she replied . " Yes , I suppose he does . " <p> " How long have you and Professor Bertram been at Princeton ? " I asked , hoping to change the subject . <p> " Nearly 30 years . Your professor was the first Jew to teach full-time in the English department at Princeton . But perhaps you already knew that . " <p> " I did n't , though I knew there was a lot of antiSemitism here until well after the war . " " Paul was-maybe he still is-what used to be called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very distinguished , you know , that his being Jewish can be set aside . Anyway , Princeton must have recognized that sooner or later they would have to acquire a Jew for the English department , so why not a superior one ? " <p> Professor Bertram 's entrance saved me from having to consider why she was telling me all this . He was wearing the same get-up as in class , and he had a Gauloise going . He looked weary . Had he been in his study , devising one of his slightly oblique , inevitably brilliant essays ? Napping ? Or was it that life with this woman was , at best , never easy ? <p> " Sherry , dear ? " Julia said . " That would be lovely , " he said , sitting down next to me on the black leather couch . He leaned forward and put a small wedge of cheese on a cracker . His wife handed him a glass . <p> " Mr. Hopkins here is thinking of going to law school , " he said to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my view . " <p> " Oh ? Why so , Paul ? " she asked . <p> " Because he has a talent for literature and , my guess is , will develop a sense of vocation for it , too . " <p> " Is your father a lawyer ? " Julia asked . <p> " Yes , " I said , " he 's now with Sullivan and Cromwell in New York . " <p> " Is n't that John Foster Dulles 's old firm ? " <p> " It was , " I answered , " but Dulles left for the State Department just before my father arrived . " <p> " A talent for literature is all very well , " said Julia Bertram , holding her glass before her as if to inspect it for cleanliness . " But a talent for life is rather better , do n't you think , Paul ? " A look passed between them , but what its significance was I could n't , just then , fathom . <p> " Lots of lawyers in the world , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read with the perception of Mr. Hopkins . " <p> " What are you proposing , dear ? " <p> " I 'm proposing that Mr. Hopkins stay on at Princeton and do a doctorate , which I would be willing to supervise . " Bertram was well known to be contemptuous of graduate students as well as of graduate studies ; that he was willing to see me through a Ph.D . was no trivial matter . It was an enormous compliment . <p> I remember that dinner was drier than the sherry . Julia served a boned chicken breast , small red potatoes , and asparagus . With a mere student as a guest , she had not bothered to hire any help , and so had to get up to serve each course herself-with , it seemed to me , a slight edge of irritation . Conversation was a bit strained . After asking about my family , and grilling me on other professors at Princeton , the Bertrams talked , for the most part between themselves , about contemporary novelists , poets , and critics . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing about Robert Lowell , " I remember Paul saying that night , " is his madness . The rest is contrived , artificial , phony . " " Quite right , dear , " Julia replied . " Another dish of ice cream , Mr. Hopkins ? " <p> MUCH TO my father 's chagrin , I rejected Harvard Law and remained at Princeton . For the next five years I did graduate work and then wrote a dissertation about Henry James as expatriate . I do not expect to know a better time . Reading and discussing James with Paul Bertram elevated me as nothing else had done , or , I suspect , ever will again . He read the major novels with a delicacy of judgment that I could not have imagined existing , and the novelist 's own character with no less refinement . Clearly Bertram understood James so deeply because he himself possessed the sensibility of a true artist , only without the vast outpouring of solid work that James-at a staggering price in loneliness , as my teacher made plain-achieved to his everlasting renown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though , was whether Paul Bertram was in fact a stunted artist . As his student and then his assistant , I came to learn things about him . His odd cautiousness , for example . Without ever mentioning it to me-and I saw him nearly every day-he had produced a slender little volume to which he gave the title Culture e ' Confidence . I first became aware of its existence when a section appeared in the English magazine Encounter . Complimenting him , I made the mistake of referring to it as the opening chapter of something which seemed to me marvelously promising . <p> " Thank you , Kenneth , " he said , " but I 'm afraid that what you read is the last chapter . " <p> My mistake , I now see , was not entirely due to ignorance . Paul Bertram 's prose style , always carefully measured , had become toward the end of his life more tentative , hesitant , even costive than before . Intended , perhaps , as an amalgam of T. S. Eliot and E. M. Forster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul 's own grave dubiety , so that between his genuine subtlety and his no less genuine doubt , his meaning became rather like a code that had to be broken to be understood . Reading Culture &; Confidence , I kept asking myself , what does he really mean ? and then , I 'm sorry to report , toward the middle of what was after all a short book , why the hell does n't he just say it ? <p> I HAD FINISHED my dissertation and accepted a job at New York University-Princeton had no place for me-when one day , over coffee in his office , Paul announced that he would like me to function , along with Julia , as an executor of his estate . He was nearing seventy , Julia was two years older than he , and such things needed looking after . <p> " I would be honored , " I said quickly . <p> " Before it 's all over , " he said , exhaling , " you are likely to be more than honored . You may well be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would have preferred to live without . " <p> " Still , just now I 'm honored . " <p> " You are , Kenneth , a solid citizen . Probably something you got from your father . My own father would have called you a fayner goy , an upstanding Gentile . " <p> " Are n't there any upstanding Jews for this job ? " <p> " None quite so upstanding as you , my boy . And you know , do n't you , Kenneth , that I have come to think of you as my boy . Had I the good luck to have had a son , I should have liked him to be as you are . " He took a deep drag on his Gauloise , and looked away . <p> " Thank you , " was all I could manage , fearful my throat would catch . <p> That evening I drove Paul back to Hun Road . He had agreed to give the T. S. Eliot Lectures at Trinity College , Dublin , in the autumn , but now he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I suggested Eliot himself , a figure whom he had known personally and for whom he had great and ( as always ) complex regard . <p> " It 's a thought , " he said , bending down to wave good-bye at the closed car window . I watched him walk up to the house , a small figure , slightly bent . From behind he seemed an old man . He stopped at the door to light a cigarette , as if needing the fortification to get him over the threshold . <p> HE NEVER lived to give the Eliot Lectures , but died of heart failure in his sleep a month after our last meeting . In her call , Julia said I would have to come to Princeton to talk with their lawyer . <p> It all seemed simple enough . The Bertrams held everything in common ownership , so there was really no property to be concerned about , aside from Paul 's personal effects . ( I asked Julia if I might have his old gold-tipped Parker 51 pen and his Dunhill lighter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in charge of all decisions having to do with Paul 's papers , and I would take over in the event of her demise . Pretty standard stuff , or so I thought at the time . <p> I had never felt quite comfortable with Julia . Sometimes I thought she viewed me as a rival for her husband 's affections , though reflecting further I rejected this as altogether too egotistical and selfgratulatory . After all , was I ever anything more than his favorite student ? He never reposed any important confidences in me ; the closest we came to intimacy was that afternoon in his office when he told me that he would have wished for a son like me . For my part , I felt I could n't ask him why he and Julia had never had children . Was it a conscious decision ? Was one of them incapable ? Was it Julia 's wish ? <p> After the lawyer , I drove Julia home . She asked me in for coffee . The little house , with its magazines and books covering just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half shabby-genteel , half bohemian-graduate student . As she sat sipping her coffee , Julia appeared to me to be in pretty good shape for someone who had just lost a husband . Was it possible that in some strange way Paul 's death had freed her , not only from the weight of his complexity but from playing second fiddle ? Now that Paul was dead , would Julia give up that first-person plural ? <p> " There is a great deal you could n't know about my husband , " she finally said , setting down her coffee . " Much that might disappoint you . " <p> " I agree with your first point , " I said , " and I 'm sorry to hear about the second . " <p> " Paul , you see , was a depressive , " she continued . " Not a clinical depressive . No physician ever diagnosed him as such , no one put him on a regimen of pills , nothing of that sort , but it came to the same thing . He was very dark , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think of as a spiritual depression . It was , as you might imagine , not all that easy to live with . " <p> " Over what , precisely , was he depressed ? " " Over his life . He had come to regard his work as second-rate . He was very lonely . He felt himself without true peers . " Here she stopped . " And he had come to regard his marriage as empty . " " Did he tell you these things ? " <p> " Not directly . " <p> " Then how can you be sure ? " <p> " Some of them I sensed . I knew Paul always wanted a child , but we were n't able to have one because of difficulties with my own female arrangements . But I thought he had long ago become resigned to it , as I had . " <p> " How do you know he was n't ? " <p> " Because of this , " she said , reaching over to pick up a manuscript on the lamp table near her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee table . I looked at the sheaf of pages-fewer , I estimated , than a hundred . The top page bore a title , " The Parched Garden . " I could see it was a manuscript of poems . <p> " I found them among my husband 's effects , " Julia said . " It broke my heart to learn he was writing these poems behind my back . There are 46 of them here . Did you know about their existence ? " <p> " Paul never mentioned them to me , " I said truthfully . <p> " I want you to take them with you and read them . Be careful , by the way ; I have made no copies . You will discover that I do not come off very well in them . It turns out I am a dry and grasping person on whom false ambition has turned sour . I am the wrong road taken , the principal , the overarching , and the irrevocable mistake of Paul 's life . " <p> " That is difficult for me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as reassuring as I hoped . <p> " The poems do not lie , " Julia said quietly . " If they were n't so damnably beautiful , I probably would never have shown them to you . But you are my co-executor . I want you to read them and tell me what you think we ought to do with them . Because I am so-how to put it ? -implicated , the decision should probably be yours exclusively . " <p> I thought at this point Julia might break down , but she did n't . As she walked me to the door , I told her I would call her directly after I 'd read the manuscript and had a chance to think a bit . She put out her hand . I grasped it . Standing on the threshold , a cool dusk wind blowing , I wondered if she would extend her cheek for a kiss . She did n't . <p> I suppose the first thing to be said about the poems in " The Parched Garden " is that they were , technically , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most delicate and tricky meters , Paul showed that he had all the moves of a great craftsman , and was still capable of giving deep pleasure to anyone who understood the nature of true poetic achievement . But the second thing to be said is that the poems were very dark : in some places bitter , in others positively poisonous . It would be pleasing to make the distinction between form and content in Paul 's manuscript , yet how many times had he told me that any such distinction was nonsense , that the two were inseparable , inextricably intertwined ? <p> To do a turn on Wordsworth , the poems seemed to me like nothing so much as emotion recollected in hostility . " A Book of Grievances " might as aptly have been their title . And Julia was right : the greatest grievance was against her . Without her , the poems made quite plain , Paul would have gone on to be the artist he wished to be . It was Julia who brought him back into the world , grounded him ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THOSE poems , I changed my view of Paul Bertram almost completely . The writer whom I had thought resigned to life 's limitations turned out not to have been resigned to anything . He turned out to have hated his life , with its little compromises and its large deceits . Civilization , he was testifying , was not worth the discontents ; far from it . <p> But what would publication do to Paul 's reputation as a critic of superior subtlety and , in Lapis Lazuli , a sublime creator ? Would n't it put in doubt all that had come before ? And where , then , did my own responsibility lie ? Suddenly I recalled an anecdote Paul had told me about a man named Rosenthal ( or was it Rosenberg ? ) , a businessman of serious intellectual interests in early-20th-century Prague . Although he himself did no writing , this Rosenthal ( let me call him ) was much respected by all the writers and intellectuals of the city . One day in 1924 , he ran into a worried-looking Max Brod . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deathbed of my dear friend Franz Kafka , and he has asked me to destroy all his writings . " <p> " Unfortunate , " replied Rosenthal , " but a deathbed wish is a sacred thing . " <p> " I know , " said Brod , " but how can I destroy the works of Franz Kafka , the greatest writer of German prose of our time ? " <p> " If you feel so strongly about it , " replied Rosenthal , " then you must not do it . " <p> " But it is a deathbed wish ! " <p> " Very well , then you must . " <p> " But how can I ? " <p> They went around like this three or four more times , until finally , losing all patience , Rosenthal said : " Look , Brod , here is the solution . You must defy Franz Kafka 's deathbed wish . Do not destroy his manuscripts . But in penance , my dear Brod , you must destroy your own . " <p> And here Bertram , smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the all-too-prolific Brod , he thought Rosenthal 's idea not bad at all , with or without the deathbed wish of Franz Kafka . <p> I tried to remember when Paul had told me this anecdote . Was it four years ago ? Five ? Could he have known at the time that he would put me in the Max Brod hot seat ? As the author of a single work , a dissertation on Henry James turned into a book currently being considered by the University of Chicago Press , not even the Rosenthal solution was available to me . <p> I read through the manuscript fully five more times before calling Julia Bertram to arrange another meeting . I had actually come to a decision , but I wanted to check it with her before acting . She was not eager to meet , and wondered why we could n't discuss the matter over the phone . I said I thought it was too important for that . Somewhat grudgingly , she relented . <p> " I told you , " she began , sitting in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that this decision is yours . " <p> " I know that , " I said , " but it does affect you , too . Surely you realize that . " <p> " Of course I do . The discovery of Paul 's poems puts not only my private life but such literary reputation as I have in an altogether different light . Since my husband 's death , I have become a perfect villainess , or I will once these poems are made public . Behind every successful man , there is a woman , they used to say ; they neglected to add that behind every failed man there is also a woman . Apparently I am now to go down in the footnotes of literary history as one of the latter . It will not surprise you to know , Kenneth , that this is not at all what I had in mind . " <p> " Tell me , " I asked , " why did n't you destroy the manuscript after you read it ? " <p> " First , because it is my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of destroying anything belonging to Paul . Second , because , hateful though I find it , I recognize that the writing is beautiful , and I am also not in the habit of destroying beautiful things . " <p> " What would you have me do ? " <p> " I believe I 've told you that I am the last person to advise you on this . " <p> " I 've come to a decision , " I said , " but I wanted you to know what it is . " <p> " And what have you decided ? " <p> " I have decided not to publish the poems while you are still alive , assuming of course that you predecease me . This way Paul 's poems , and the views that may be read into them , will not cause you any pain on earth . " <p> " Very considerate of you , Kenneth , " Julia said . <p> " I shall feel the pain only through eternity . " <p> " What do you mean ? " <p> " What I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ betrayed me , and betrayed me sorely . He has made plain that my own life has been without meaning , unless its meaning is that I have existed solely in order to make life worse for a man named Paul Bertram . Whether the world knows about this while I am alive or after I am dead scarcely matters , does it ? " <p> " No , I said , feeling profoundly my own insensitivity . " I suppose it does n't . " <p> It was a windy day , and at the door , as I was leaving , Julia told me that she was thinking of moving to Arizona . She had a younger sister , also widowed , living near Tucson . The Eastern winters were beginning to get to her , and her sister was all the family she had left in the world . Once again we shook hands , this time with the tacit realization that we might never meet again . <p> GETTING INTO my car , I placed Paul 's manuscript on the front seat next to me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not waving as I pulled away , the once-formidable figure now frail and hopelessly vulnerable . Driving out of Princeton , I thought about Paul and what he would have wanted done with this manuscript on which he had worked with such obviously painstaking care . Although the poems had the polish of finished work , there was no way of knowing exactly when he had written them . Had he , I wondered , completed this manuscript years ago and felt unable , or unwilling , or insufficiently courageous to publish it during his lifetime ? That he would have wanted it published at some point , I was sure . Was I now recruited to be his accomplice against his own wife , against his own life ? Was that what he had meant in calling me a fayner goy-that I could be relied upon to carry out a job like this ? And what , in such a situation , did upstandingness consist of , anyway ? <p> On the New Jersey Turnpike the wind rocked the heavy car . I leaned over and removed the rubber band @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in triplets , was titled " The Millstone . " Keeping an eye on the road , I could barely make out the words , though the elegance of the form exerted its own small seductiveness . <p> I must have drifted out of my lane , for a driver coming up on the left gave me three sharp blasts of his horn . I pressed a button , and the window on the driver 's side slid down with a deep purr of inevitability . Holding out Paul Bertram 's single surviving manuscript , and taking a deep breath , I released it , all of it , into the wind . Through the rear-view mirror I could see nothing but perfectly made poems scattering over the New Jersey Turnpike . Had a cop been around , I suppose I might have been stopped for littering . Fair enough . The fine would have been worth it . <p> Author Affiliation 
##1003705 THE HOTEL , IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE , WAS Egyptian in motif and baffling in its design , as if the architect had proceeded with his first draft and been wildly off target . Corridors that seemed intriguing suddenly turned dark and came to an abrupt ending . The bar was out on a weird limb . Only with luck could Jack find his room without assistance . At first , he took on some of the responsibility for his confusion , assuming that the hotel was probably brilliant in its conception and it was his fault for not getting the hang of it . He then learned that a group of Lebanese had lost millions on its wild and purposeless construction and had finally thrown up their hands and sold it back to the French at an enormous loss . The new owners , offering immaculate service , caviar , and fresh croissants , were inching their way toward a profit . <p> He had come to France for some talks with a film actor he admired named Marty Hatcher . Brilliant in his career in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gotten rich . He continued to be brilliant in flashes , and . it was the flashes that Jack remembered -- a lop-sided smile , a ridiculous walk , the perfect mispronunciation of a familiar word . Which was not why Jack made the trip . A French producer had paid for it ; considerable sums would come Jack 's way if the proposed film got off the ground . <p> A nice bonus was that he liked Hatcher , although their first meeting had begun ominously . Much like the design of Jack 's hotel , the notion he proposed to Hatcher had been wildly off target Jack saw himself as having made a wasted trip and falling into general despair . In this situation , another star might have been cruel and let him flounder . But Hatcher had gently eased him onto safe and comfortable ground . In essence , what they would do is keep the outlines of Jack 's idea and drop the politics ( an irritant to the nonpolitical Hatcher ) . And they would , of course , hold on to the fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hatcher 's fourth wife , a lovely woman named Hillary who had to be some three decades or more younger than the sixtyish Hatcher . It was only when Hatcher had pushed aside the crisis that Jack felt able to take his first deep , satisfied breath . The days that followed were cozy and peaceful -- cool , off-season nights , light work , ripe local wines , the three of them taking trips to inspect the seaside house that Hatcher was having built in a nearby village . Portuguese construction men with fat hands lovingly shaped the new beams . <p> All of this pleasure in spite of the fact that their group was off-balance . Jack was alone . Hatcher 's wife had a perfect face and wide , astonished eyes ; it was as if amazing stories were continually being whispered in her ear . Hillary drove them about in a Ferrari at hair-raising speeds . Jack assumed she was a good driver , although her success depended upon everyone else , pedestrians and other drivers , playing their roles to perfection . She had done a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls bewildered by first love . But she did not have the usual starlet background . Her father had been a naturalist of some prominence and her mother , a poet , had once been short-listed for the Booker Prize . <p> There was an instant connection between Hillary and Jack , but he chose , not to ignore it , to finesse it . At the end of the evening , when they were lightly and happily drunk on wine , the three oft hem would stand and hug one another , a three-way embrace . Then Jack would return to his hotel to think about Hatcher and wonder about Hillary , though not to covet her . He was alone , but he did not feel in the least bit lonely . As long as the visit did not go on and on . <p> While their new house as being built , Hatcher and his wife had rented a villa some five hundred yards from Jack 's puzzle of a hotel . Hatcher , who had suffered a stroke , liked to sleep late and to begin work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in foreign countries , that left him with the morning to kill . He took fresh walks through a nearby forest area , trying to ignore the giant patrolling dogs of a breed he had never encountered , then fingered merchandise in the port area ; after breakfast , he sat out on the wharf , putting his face up to the sun . Out of the corner of his eye , he watched fishermen making operatically hostile gestures at one another -- any one of which would have caused instant death in the city in which Jack lived . But these raucous combatants were friends and generally walked off arm in arm . Promptly at noon , he would appear at Hatcher 's villa , generally to find that the actor had not arisen . Hillary would flash by in a robe ; legs exposed , apologetically running her hands through ringlets of golden hair . Hatcher would appear soon after , also in a robe , dazed , flushed , also apologetic , and begin to imitate Frenchmen for Jack , as an offering for his being late . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imitations of eccentrics he wanted to work into the movie -- spinsters , mad Englishmen , adenoidal Frenchmen , doddering old white colonials . He would do them into a German-made tape recorder , one of several dozen he had placed around the house , the idea being that Jack would take the cassettes back to the States , to be referred to while he did the work . Hatcher would simply break into these imitations , taking no time at all to prepare or to get into character . This was a phenomenon to Jack , more so than the brilliance of the imitations . Often , he wondered if Hatcher had any real character of his own , other than to be sweet and befiddled . <p> One day , at noon , Jack let himself into the villa and sensed an unusual stillness in the air . Since the work was casual you could not say that he and Hatcher were at any critical juncture in the project . They had a strong middle section , so it did not seem terribly important that they did not quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would get it . After half an hour or so during which neither Hatcher nor Hillary tumbled out in a robe , Jack , somewhat shy about doing so , shouted out , " Anyone home ? " <p> Hillary came out to greet him , shaken , as if someone had told her a fairy tale with a horrible ending . <p> " Is anything wrong ? " Jack asked , idiotically , since it was plain that something was . <p> " Marty 's had a terrible row with Ian St. Clair , " said Hillary , barely able to get out the words . Jack recognized the name Ian St. Clair as that of a young financial wizard who had saved fabled rock groups from insolvency and now served as Hatcher 's representative . <p> Hatcher soon appeared , the color gone from his face , his dressing gown dipping low and revealing what might have been the start of a woman 's breasts . In the ensuing hour , calls and cables went back and forth to London . In bits and pieces , Jack learned that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's recommended projects . Somewhere along the line , St. Clair had suggested that Hillary had been interfering in Hatcher 's life . St. Clair had actually gotten her on the phone and berated her . <p> " I believe he called you a cunt , did n't he , darling ? " said Hatcher mildly , after the last of the calls . <p> " How can he say that ? " Hillary had responded , her mouth trembling . <p> She turned to Jack , distraught , and said , " I 've been modest in my suggestions -- and everything I 've done has been to shore up my husband . " <p> " There , there , " said Hatcher , covering his wife 's hands with his own . " We 'll get it straightened out , do n't you worry . Ian does n't know diddly about creative affairs . " <p> Jack listened to all of this and found it incomprehensible that a financial adviser would berate a client 's wife . " Listen , " he said , " this is none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The idea of a financial person uttering a single word about your private life ... " Then he became so choked up with anger that he was forced to stop and collect himself . <p> " You do n't know Ian , " said Hatcher despairingly . <p> " I do n't have to know him , " said Jack . " I know all about him from what you 've told me . " <p> " We 're locked together in a hundred situations , " said Hatcher . " I ca n't very well just dump all of my affairs on someone else 's desk . I 'd be ruined . " <p> " I do n't care how brilliant he is , " said Jack . " There are other brilliant people . By six o'clock tonight , you can have a line of them around the block . And they wo n't have a word to say about your wife . " <p> " You know , " said Hatcher to Hillary , " I believe old Jack here may be onto something . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study . After ten minutes or so , Hillary appeared , the tears erased . Handing Jack a cassette , she said , " This is Marty 's response to Ian . " <p> Jack slipped it into a cassette player and heard the following , in the voice of the famed comedian . <p> " My dear Ian . Stop . My wife is an utter delight . Stop . She has only been a comfort to me . Stop . If Hillary is hurting me , then the Queen Mother is a dyke . Stop . Why are you trying to spoil our fine relationship of five years ? Stop . Your totally confused friend . Stop . Marty . " <p> " It 's quite forceful , do n't you feel ? " said Hillary . <p> " Can we take a drive ? " said Jack . <p> bY LATE AFTERNOON , SOME of the color had come back into Hatcher 's face . Emerging from his study , he broke into an imitation of an aging third-rate French nightclub singer , moving through imaginary ringside tables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three of them drove out to a favorite local vineyard , Hatcher at the wheel , Hillary uncharacteristically at his side , as if the film star had arrived at some new truth in his life . By silent agreement , it was decided that they would discontinue the work . Jack would gather up the tapes , return to the States , work on the script , and return in a couple of months with a first draft . That night , they went to a legendary French restaurant with amazingly tall waiters . After a highly satisfactory dinner , Hatcher asked one of them if he could sniff the bouquet of all the fruit brandies . <p> " And perhaps a shoe if you 've got a loose one about . " <p> The brandies were presented by an unflappable waiter , but not the shoe . All of this fell short of being hysterically funny , but indicated to Jack that his friend may at least have come out of the woods . <p> " I 'm sorry you had to be subjected to all that unpleasantness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about you , " said Jack . <p> Outside , ; what appeared to be a whole season 's worth of rain suddenly came down . Hatcher insisted on going to get the car , more evidence of his returning vigor . Jack and Hillary waited beneath an awning . Almost imperceptibly , she moved her hair against his face . He tried to ignore this . In the car , she said , " I was only doing what I felt a wife should do . Marty 's wife , your wife , Jack , anyone 's wife . " <p> " I do n't relish the prospect , " said Hatcher , not hearing this , " but I 'm afraid I 'll have to go to London tomorrow and thrash this out with Ian . " <p> At the villa , they said a quick goodbye . Jack was always more brisk in these situations than his heart wanted him to be . He would have to get around to correcting that . He kissed Hillary on the cheek and she offered her other cheek for a kiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved forward as if to return the expected embrace . But they both drew back and settled for claps on the back and a good handshake . <p> " I 'll see you in a month or so , " said Jack . " Thanks for the many kindnesses . " <p> " Be well , dear boy , " said Hatcher . <p> iT WAS JACKS DAUGHTER WHO TOLD HIM THE NEWS . She met him at the airport and they decided to have dinner in town , jet lag or no jet lag . <p> " Have you heard about Mr. Hatcher ? " she asked . <p> She was a quiet girl who always looked at him out of the corner of her eye . She was sixteen , lived with mother , and kept a key to Jack 's apartment . <p> " He had some kind of attack , " she said . " It was on the six o'clock news . " <p> Back at his apartment , Jack called his French producer , who was a giggler , and who reported the following information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had suffered an attack of food poisoning . The doctors were not taking any chances . Considering the actor 's history of poor health , they had taken him to Charing Cross Hospital for observation . ( The French producer even worked a giggle into this conversation . ) <p> Jack went ahead and had dinner with his daughter . <p> " I saw it coming , " he said and told her the story of Hatcher and the financial adviser . <p> " Maybe it 's cheap psychology , but he did not want to go to that meeting with St. Clair . He was afraid of him , and , either consciously or not , he got himself good and sick so he could avoid it . " <p> Jack 's daughter wanted to hear Hatcher on the cassettes ; at his apartment , they listened to the actor do a demented English schoolteacher , a mad archaeologist who 'd been lost in the jungle , and a Hispanic drug dealer . ( This last was off by a hair . ) That night , Jack worried about Hatcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about their project as well . Did that make him a selfish individual ? <p> The food poisoning turned out to be a cover story designed to mask a serious heart attack . Hatcher died the next day . It was apparently not the first heart attack and the actor had been secretly wearing a pacemaker . The death received a huge amount of press coverage , which pleased Jack , who had been disappointed when the food poisoning got only a few lines in the press . He had all kinds of thoughts . The wildest and most presumptuous one had to do with whether Hatcher , on his deathbed , had willed him something -- a piece of sensitive high-tech recording equipment , for example . He was glad that he had attacked the guru financier . What he as sorriest about was that he had n't gone ahead and given Hatcher the farewell hug . He talked to his daughter about Hatcher a lot . <p> " You could n't make it stick in a normal court , " he said " but that son of a bitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that more and more in Hollywood , some bean counter telling me how to tell a story . And this is where it can lead . " <p> He thought of flying to London and confronting St. Clair with the accusation , but he knew he never would . Though he considered himself a moral man , he was aware that he lacked a moral follow-through . The film project , of course , foundered . No one who was available could quite fill Hatcher 's shoes . There was some talk of the great Vittorio Gassman , but it would have meant starting from scratch , and Jack had no heart to do so . The French producer paid him half the money that was due -- a fairly honorable gesture as these things go . <p> Jack was not astonished when Hillary called from London after several wee and said that she and her mother were going to be visiting the States and could they all get together . Jack felt a buzzing in his legs as he talked to her and said of course , yes . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news that she was being considered for a role in a major film that would feature several international stars . All were on the level of Maximilian Schell , who had already been signed . Hillary had gained some weight and was now hopelessly beautiful . Other than to say it was awful , they did not discuss Hatcher . There did n't seem to be much more to be said . Jack took her to his apartment , which was somewhat lavish , at least in size . He quickly explained that it had been leased for him as part of a film deal . They had never kissed before , but made love almost immediately , as if by prearrangement . He had n't felt they were far enough along in their affair for this to happen , but she turned her back and did a slow , naked dance for him against the blinds . Of course , he made love to her again . She decided that night that she would give up acting , which had never interested her , and enroll in a graduate course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Jack , she would stay with him for a while . It was all right with Jack , although he had lived alone for several years and had to wonder if he would be able to function with someone in residence . <p> It worked out decently in some respects . She turned out to be a magnificent cook , her specialization being the sauces of Provence . Part of his regimen had been an almost reflexive nightly visit to a saloon whose raffish following included writers , artists , film types , and the like . She became his companion on these visits , which soon tapered off . They stayed in much of the time , making love at a civilized pace until one of them picked up the tempo . He felt that it was Hillary . Though twenty years her senior , he managed , though barely , to keep stride . <p> Jack did not get much work done , although he played at it , putting in the requisite time , attacking his new project with his usual thoroughness . But he felt self-conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his shoe . One night , after he had finished going through the motions at his desk , he lay back on his recliner and his thoughts drifted to poor Hatcher , his brilliant improvisations , his drained and befuddled look as he emerged from his bedroom suite each day at noon . This in turn led him to reflect on Ian St. Clair , whose attempt to separate Hillary and Hatcher had , in Jack 's view , sent the poor actor to his grave <p> Hillary returned from class soon after and immediately came up behind him , smelling of the street , her hair brushing up against his cheek . She bit his earlobe gently , reminding him of her fierce and exquisite teeth . <p> " What 's up ? ' he asked . <p> " Nothing , darling , " she said . " I was wondering if you had any plans for the evening . " <p> It occurred to him that they had made love that morning and the night before and in the afternoon of the previous day as well , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had moved in , on more occasions than he dared to remember . <p> Nonetheless , he got to his feet , took her appealingly damp hand , and wearily followed her into the bedroom , thinking that he had done Ian St. Clair a grave injustice . <p> 
##1003706 bRIAN GOLD WAS AT THE TOP OF THE HILL when the dog attacked . A big black wolflike dog attached to a chain , it came flying off a back porch and tore through its yard into the park , moving easily in spite of the deep snow , making for Gold 's daughter . He waited for the chain to pull the dog up short , but the dog kept coming . Gold plunged down the hill , shouting as he went . Snow and wind deadened his voice . Anna 's sled as almost at the bottom of the slope . Gold had raised the hood of her parka against the needling gusts , and he knew that she could not hear him or see the dog racing toward her . He was conscious of the dog 's speed and of his own dreamy progress , the weight of his gum boots , the clinging trap of crust beneath the new snow . His overcoat napped at his knees . He screamed one last time as the dog mad its line , and at that moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her face . Gold was barely halfway down the hill , arms pumping , feet sliding in the boots . He seemed to be running in place , held at a fixed , unbridgeable distance as the dog dragged Anna backward off the sled , shaking her like a doll . Gold threw himself down the hill helplessly , then the distance vanished and he was there . <p> The sled was overturned , the snow churned up ; the dog had marked this ground as its own . It still had Anna by the shoulder . Gold beard the rage boiling in its gut . He saw the tensed hindquarters and the flattened ears and the red gleam of gum under the wrinkled snout . Anna was on her back , her face bleached and blank , staring at the sky . She had never looked so small . Gold seized the chain and yanked at it but could get no purchase in the snow . The dog only snarled more fiercely and started shaking Anna again . She did n't make a sound . Her silence made Gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog and hooked his arm under its neck and pulled back hard . Still the dog would n't let go . Gold felt its heat and the profound rumble of its will . With his other hand he tried to pry the jaw loose . His gloves turned slippery with drool ; he could n't get a grip . Gold 's mouth was next to the dog 's ear . He said , " Let go , damn you , " and then he took the ear between his teeth and bit down with everything he had . He heard a yelp and something cracked against his nose , knocking him backward . When he pushed himself up , the dog was running for home , jerking its head from side to side , scattering flecks of blood on the snow . <p> " THE WHOLE THING TOOK MAYBE SIXTY SECONDS , " GOLD said . " Maybe less . But it went on forever . " He 'd told the story many times now , and always mentioned this . He knew it was trite to marvel at the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to . Nor could he stop himself from repeating that it was a " miracle " -- the radiologist 's word -- that Anna had n't been crippled or disfigured , or even killed ; and that her doctor did not understand how she 'd escaped damage to her bones and nerves . Though badly bruised , her skin had n't even been broken . <p> Gold loved his daughter 's face . He loved her face as a thing in itself , to be wondered at , studied . Yet after the attack he could n't look at Anna in the same way . Yet kept seeing the dog lunge at her , and himself stuck forever : on that hill ; then his heart began to kick , and he grew taut and restless and angry . He did n't want to think about the dog anymore -- he wanted it out of the picture . It should be put down . It was crazy , a menace , and it was still there , waiting to tear into some other kid , because the police refused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , " he said . " Nothing . " <p> He was going through the whole story again with his cousin Tom Rourke on a Sunday afternoon , a week after the attack . Gold had called him the night it happened , but the part about the police was new , and Rourke got all worked up just as Gold expected . His cousin had an exacting , irritable sense of justice and a ready store of loyal outrage that Gold had drawn on ever since they were boys . He had been alone in his anger for a week now and wanted some company . Though his wife claimed to be angry too , she had n't seen what he had seen . The dog was an abstraction to her , and she was n't one to brood anyway . <p> What was their excuse ? Rourke wanted to know What reason did the cops give for their complete and utter worthessness ? <p> " The chain , " Gold said . " They said -- this is the really beautiful part -- they said that since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " But the dog was n't chained up , right ? " <p> " He was , but the chain reaches into the park . I mean , way in -- a good thirty , forty feet . " <p> " By that logic , he could be on a chain ten miles long and legally chew up the whole fucking town . <p> " Exactly . " <p> Rourke got up and went to the picture window . He stood close to the glass and glowered at the falling snow . <p> " What is it with Nazis and dogs ? They 've got a real thing going , ever notice that ? " Still looking out the window , he said , " Have you talked to a lawyer ? " <p> " Day before yesterday . " <p> " What 'd he say ? " <p> " She . Kate Stiller . Said the police were full of shit . Then she told me to forget it . According to her , the dog 'll die of old age before we ever get near a courtroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Brian me boy . They 'll give you all the justice you want , as long as it 's up the ass . " <p> There was a loud thump on the ceiling . Anna was playing upstairs with Rourke 's boy , Michael . Both men raised their eyes and waited , and when no one screamed , Gold said , " I do n't know why I even bothered to call her . I do n't have the money to pay for a lawyer . " <p> " You know what happened , " Rourke said . " The cop who took the complaint fucked it up , and now the others are covering for him . So , you want to take him out ? " <p> " The cop ? " <p> " I was thinking of the dog . " <p> " You mean kill the dog ? " <p> Rourke just looked at Gold . <p> " Is that what you 're saying ? Kill the dog ? <p> Rourke grinned , but he still did n't say anything . <p> " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Christ , Tom , I ca n't believe I 'm talking like this . " <p> " But you are . " Rourke shoved the naugahyde ottoman with his foot until it was facing Gold , then sat on it and leaned forward , so close their knees were touching . " No poison or glass . That 's chickenshit , I would n't do that to my worst enemy . Take him out clean . " <p> " Christ , Tom . " Gold tried to laugh . <p> " You can use my Remington , scope him in from the hill . Or if you want , get up close with the 12-gauge or the .44 Magnum . You ever fired a pistol ? " <p> " No . " <p> " Better forget the Magnum , then . " <p> " I ca n't do this . " <p> " Sure you can . " <p> " They 'll know it us me . I 've been raising hell about that dog all week . Who do you think they 're going to come after when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> Rourke sucked in his cheeks . " Point taken , " he said . " Okay , you ca n't do it . But I sure as hell can . " <p> " No . Forget it , Tom . " <p> " You and Mary go out for the night . Have dinner at Chez Nicole or Pauly 's , someplace small where they 'll remember you . By the time you get home it 's all over and you 're clean as a whistle . " <p> Gold finished his beer . <p> " We 've got to take care of business , Brian . If we do n't , nobody will . " <p> " Maybe if I did it . Maybe . Having you do it -- that just does n't feel right . " <p> " What about that dog still running wild after what it did to Anna ? Does that feel right ? " When Gold did n't answer , Rourke shook his knee . " Did you really bite the mutt 's ear ? " <p> " I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " No . " <p> " But you drew blood , right ? You lasted blood . " <p> " I got some in my mouth , yes . I could n't help it . " <p> " It tasted good , did n't it ? Come on , Brian , do n't bullshit me , it tasted good . " <p> " There was a certain satisfaction , " Gold said . <p> " You want to do what 's right , " Rourke said . " I appreciate that . I value that . It 's your call , okay ? But the offer stands . " <p> rOURKE PRODUCED THE CRACK ABOUT NAZIS AND dogs not from deep reflection , Gold knew , but because to call people Nazis was his first response to any vexation or slight . Once he 'd heard Rourke say it , though , Gold could not forget it . The picture that came to mind was one he 'd pondered before : a line of frenzied dogs harrying Jews along a railway platform . <p> Gold was Jewish on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he was young , and he 'd been raised Catholic by his mother . His name did n't suit him ; he sensed it made him seem ridiculous . When you heard Gold , what else could you think of but gold ? With that name he should be a rich sharpie , not a mackerel-snapper with a dying business . The black kids who came into is video store were unmistakably of that opinion . They had a mock-formal way of saying " Mr. Gold , " drawing out the word as if it were the precious substance itself . Finding themselves a little short on the rental fee , some of them were n't above asking him to make up the difference out of his own-deep pockets and acting amazed if he refused . The rusty Toyota he kept parked out front was a puzzle to them , a conversation piece ; they could n't figure out why , with all his money , he did n't get himself a decent set of wheels . One night , standing at the counter with her friends , a girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was afraid the brothers would steal it . They 'd been goofing on him , just messing around , but when she said this everyone went silent as if a hard truth had been spoken . <p> Cadillac . What else ? <p> After years of estrangement , Gold had returned to the Catholic church , and went weekly to Mass to sustain his fragile faith , but he understood that in the eyes of the world he as a Jew . He had never known what to make of that . There were things he saw in himself that he thought of as Jewish , traits not conspicuous among the mostly Irish boys he 'd grown up with , including his cousins . Bookishness , patience , a taste for classical music and complicated moralizing , aversion to alcohol and violence . All this he found acceptable . But he had certain other tendencies , less dear to him , that he also suspected of being Jewish . Corrosive self-mockery . Bouts of almost paralyzing skepticism : Physical awkwardness . A disposition toward passivity , even surrender , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that these ideas of Jewishness were also held by anti-Semites , and he resisted their influence , without much success . <p> In the already familiar picture that Rourke had conjured up , of Jews being herded by dogs , Gold sensed an instance of the resignation that he disliked in himself . He knew it was unfair to blame people for not fighting an evil that their very innocence made them incapable of imagining , yet even while admitting that they were brutalized and starved and in shock , he could n't help but wonder : Why did n't one of them hit a guard -- grab his gun -- take some of the bastards with him ? Do something ? Even in his awareness of the terrible injustice of this question , he 'd never really laid it to rest . <p> And with that old image vivid in his thoughts , it seemed to Gold that the question had now been put to him . Why did n't he do something ? His own daughter had been savaged by just such a dog , a flinch away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insanity , felt its furious will to hurt . And it was still out there , lying in wait , because no one , not even Gold himself , would do what needed to be done . He could n't escape the consciousness of his own inaction . In the days following his conversation with Rourke , it became intolerable . No matter where else he was , at home or in the store , he was also on that hill , unable to move or speak , watching the dog come at Anna with murder in its heart and the chain gliding behind like an infinite black snake . <p> He drove by the park late one day and stopped across the street from the house where the dog 's owners lived . It was a colonial with a line of dormer windows , a big expensive house like most of the others around the park . Gold thought he could guess why the police had been so docile . This was n't a shooting gallery , a crib for perpetrators and scofflaws . The deep thunk of the brass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the foyer , the Cinderella sweep of the staircase with its monumental newel post and gleaming rail -- all this would tell you that the law was among friends here . Of course a dog needed room to roam . If people let their kids go tearing off every which way , they 'd have to live with the consequences . Some folks were just natural-born whiners . <p> Though Gold despaired of the police , he believed he understood them . He did not understand the people who 'd allowed this to happen . They had never called to apologize , or even to ask how Anna was . They seemed not to care that their dog was a killer . Gold had driven here with some notion of sitting down with them , helping them see what they ought to do -- as if they 'd even let him in the door . What a patsy <p> He called Rourke that night and told him to go ahead . <p> rOURKE WAS HOT ON THE IDEA OF GOLD TAKING Mary out for dinner -- his treat -- on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the event , which seemed to include the two of them toasting him with champagne while he did whatever he meant to do . Gold refused the offer . Mary did n't know what they were up to , and he could n't sit across a table from her for three hours , even as the deed was being done , without telling . She would n't like it , but she would n't be able to stop it ; the knowledge would only be a burden to her . Gold employed a graduate student named Simms who covered the store at night , except for Tuesdays , when he had a seminar . Though Rourke was disappointed by Gold 's humdrum dramaturgy , he assented : Tuesday night it was . <p> More snow fell that morning , followed by an ice storm . The streets and sidewalks were still glazed by nightfall and business was slow . As always , Gold had a new release playing in the monitor above the counter , but he could n't follow the plot through the frantic cutting and ugly music , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in another . That left the store oddly quiet . Maybe for this reason his customers did n't linger in the usual way , shooting the breeze with Gold and one another . They made their selections , paid , and left . He tried to read the paper . At 8:30 , Anna called to say she 'd won a poster contest at school . After she hung up , Gold witnessed a fight in front of the Domino 's across the street . Two men , drunk or drugged , had a shouting match , and one of them took a clumsy swing at the other . They grappled and fell down together on the ice . A deliveryman and one of the cooks came outside and helped them up , then walked them off in different directions . Gold , microwaved the chili left over from Sunday dinner . He ate slowly , watching the sluggish procession of cars and the hunched , gingerly trudge of people past his window . Mary had laid on the cumin with a free hand , which was just how Gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he took off his sweater . The baseboard heaters ticked . The long fluorescent lights buzzed overhead . <p> Rourke called just before ten , when Gold was closing up . " Scooter has buried his last bone , " he said . <p> " Scooter ? " <p> " That was his name . " <p> " I wish you had n't told me . " <p> " I got his collar for you -- a little memento . " <p> " For Christ 's sake , Tom . " <p> " Do n't worry , you 're clear . " <p> " Just do n't tell me any more , " Gold said . " I 'm afraid I 'll say too much when the police come by . " <p> " They 're not gon na come by . The way I fixed things , they wo n't even low what happened . " He coughed . " It had to be done , Brian . " <p> " I guess . " <p> " No guessing about it . But I 've got ta say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " I 'm sorry Tom . I should 've done it myself . " <p> " It was n't any fun , I 'll tell you that . " Rourke fell silent . Gold could hear him breathing . " I about froze my ass off . I thought they 'd never let the damned beast out . " <p> " I wo n't forget it , " Gold said . <p> " De nada . It 's over . Go in peace . " <p> iN LATE MARCH , ROURKE CALLED GOLD WITH A STORY of his own . He 'd been gassing up on Erie Boulevard when a BMW backed away from the air hose and put a crease in his door . He yelled at the driver , a black man wearing sunglasses and a knit cap . The driver ignored him . He looked straight ahead and drove off across the lot into the road , but not before Rourke got a good look at his license plate . It was a vanity tag , easy to remember -- SCUSE ME . Rourke called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him for leaving the scene of an accident . <p> So far , so good . Then it turned out the driver did n't have insurance . Rourke 's company agreed to cover most of the bill -- eight hundred bucks for a lousy dent -- but that still left him with the three-hundred-dollar deductible . Rourke figured Mr. SCUSE ME should make up the difference . His insurance agent gave him the man 's name and particulars , and Rourke started calling him . He called twice at reasonable hours , after dinner , but both times the woman who answered said he was n't in and gave Rourke the number of a club on Townsend , where he got an answering machine . Though he left clear messages , he heard nothing back . Finally Rourke called the first number at 7:00 A.M. and got the man himself , Mr. Vick Barnes . <p> " That 's V-I-C-K , " Rourke said . " Ever notice the way they do that with their names ? You shorten Victor , you get Vic , right ? V-I-C . So where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , S-E-A-N . Been spelled like that for about five hundred years . But not them , they 've got ta spell it S-H-A-W-N . Like they have a right to that name in the first place . " <p> " What did he say ? " <p> " Gave me a lot of mouth , natch . First he gets indignant that I woke him up , then he says he 's already been through all this shit with the police , and he does n't believe he hit anybody anyway . Then he hangs up on me . " <p> Rourke said he knew better than to call back ; he was n't going to get anywhere with this guy . Instead he went to the club , Jack 's Shady Corner , where it turned out Mr. Vick Barnes worked as a deejay and no doubt retailed dope on the side . All the deejays did . Where else would he get the dough for a new Beamer ? But Rourke had to admit he was quite the pro , our Mr. Barnes , nice mellow voice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and watched the dancers , then went looking for the car . <p> It was n't in the lot . Rourke poked around and found it off by itself in a little nook behind the club , where it would n't get run into by drunks . He was going back tonight to give Mr. Vick Barnes a taste of his own medicine , plus a little extra for the vigorish . <p> " You ca n't , " Gold said . " They 'll know it was you . " <p> " Let'em prove it . " <p> Gold had understood from the start where this story was taking him , even if Rourke had n't . When he said , " I 'll do it , " he felt as if he were reading the words from a script . <p> " No need , Brian . I got it covered . " <p> " Wait a minute . Just hang on . " Gold put the receiver down and took care of an old woman who was renting The Sound of Music . Then he picked it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Look , I ca n't let this guy fuck me over and just walk away . Next thing , everybody in town 'll be lining up to give me the wood . " <p> " I told you , I 'll handle it . Not tonight -- there 's a talent show at school . Thursday . " <p> " You sure , Brian ? " <p> " I said I 'd do it . Did n't I just say I 'd do it ? " <p> " Only if you really want to . Okay ? Do n't feel like you have to . " <p> rOURKE STOPPED BY THE STORE THURSDAY AFTERnoon with instructions and equipment : two gallons of Olympic redwood stain to pour over the BMW ; a hunting knife to slash the tires and score the paint , and a crowbar to break the windshield . Gold was to exercise extreme caution . He should work fast . He should leave his car running and pointed in the direction of a clear exit . If for any reason things did n't look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff in the trunk of Gold 's car . <p> " Where are you going to be ? " Gold asked . <p> " Chez Nicole . Same place you 'd have gone if you had any class . " <p> " I had a good sole meuniere last time I was there . " <p> " Prime rib for this bad boy . Rare . Taste of blood , eh , Brian ? " <p> Gold watched him drive off . It was a warm day , the third in a row . Last week 's snow had turned gray and was offering up its holdings of beer cans and dog turds . The gutters overflowed with melt , and the sun shone on the wet pavement and the broken glass in front of Domino 's , which had abruptly closed three weeks earlier . Rourke 's brake lights flashed . He stopped and backed up . Gold waited while the electric window descended . then leaned toward the car . <p> " Careful , Brian , okay ? " <p> " You know me . " <p> " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's something you definitely want to avoid . " <p> gOLD DROVE TO THE CLUB at 11:30 with the idea that there would n't be much coming and going at that hour on a weeknight . The casual drinkers would already be home , the serious crowd settling in for the duration . A dozen or so cars were scattered across the lot . Gold backed into a space as close to the rear of the building as he could get . He turned the engine off and looked around , then popped the trunk , took the crowbar , and moved into the shadows around back . The BMW as parked where Rourke said it would be , in the short driveway between the alley and the dumpster . <p> Gold had no intention of using the stain or the life . Rourke had suffered a dent ; that was no reason to destroy a man 's car . One good dent in return would even things up between Rourke and Barnes and settle his own debt in the bargain . If Rourke wanted more , he was strictly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beautiful machine , a gleaming black 328 with those special wheels that gang members were supposedly killing one another over . The dealership where Gold took his Toyota for repairs also had the local BMW boutique , and he always paid a visit to the showroom while he waited . He liked to open and close the doors , sit in the leather seats and work he gears , compare options and prices . Fully loaded , this model ran in the neighborhood of forty grand . Gold could n't imagine Mr. Vick Barnes qualifying for that kind of a loan on a deejay 's salary , so he must have paid in cash . Rourke was right . He was dealing . <p> Gold hefted the crowbar . He felt the driving pulse of the music through the club walls , heard the vocalist -- he would n't call him a singer -- shouting along with menace and complaint . It was a strange thing . You sold drugs to your own people , ruined their neighborhoods , turned their children into prostitutes and thugs , and you became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But try to run a modest business , bring something good into their community , and you were a bloodsucking parasite and a Child of Satan . Mr. Gold . He smacked the bar against his palm . He was thinking maybe he 'd do a little something with that knife after all . The stain , too . He could find uses for the stain . <p> A woman laughed in the parking lot and a man answered in a low voice . Gold crouched behind the dumpster and waited until their headlights raked the darkness and vanished . His hand was tight around the metal . He could feel his own rage , and distrusted it . Only a fool acted out of anger . No , he would do exactly what as fair , what he had decided on before coming here . <p> Gold walked around to the driver 's side of the BMW . He held the crowbar with both hands and touched the curved end against the door at bumper height , where Rourke 's car would have been hit . He adjusted his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crowbar like a bat and swung it with everything he had , knowing just as the act passed beyond recall how absolutely he had betrayed himself . The shock of the blow raced up his arms . He dropped the crowbar and left it where it fell . <p> VICTOR EMMANUEL BARNES FOUND IT THERE THREE hours later . He knelt and ran his hand along the jagged cleft in the car door , flecks of paint curling away under his fingertips . He knew exactly who had done this . He picked up the crowbar , tossed it on the passenger seat and drove straight to the apartment building where Devereaux lived . As he sped through the empty streets he howled and pounded the dashboard . He stopped in a shriek of brakes and seized the crowbar and ran up the stairs to Devereaux 's door . He pounded the door with his fist . I told you next week , you motherfucker . I told you next week . He demanded to be let in . He heard voices , but when no one answered him he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowbar . It creaked and strained . Then it gave and Barnes staggered into the apartment , yelling for Devereaux . <p> But Devereaux was n't home . His sixteen-year-old nephew , Marcel , was spending the night on the couch after helping Devereaux 's little girl write an essay . He stood facing the door while Barnes jimmied it , is aunt and cousins and grandmother gathered behind him at the end of the hall , shaking and clinging to one another . When Barnes stumbled bellowing inside , Marcel tried co push him back out . They struggled . Barnes shoved him away and swung the crowbar , catching Marcel right across the temple . The boy 's eyes went wide . His mouth opened . He sank to his knees and pitched facedown on the floor . Barnes looked at Marcel , then at the old woman coming toward him . " Oh , Jesus , " he said , and dropped the crowbar and ran down the stairs and outside to his car . He drove to his grandmother 's house and told her what had happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocked over him and wept and prayed . Then she called the police . <p> Marcel 's death was on the morning news . very half hour they ran the story , with pictures of both him and Barnes . Barnes was shown being hustled into a cruiser , Marcel standing before his exhibit at the All-County Science Fair . He had been an honors student at Morris Fields High , a volunteer in the school 's Big Brother program , and a past president of the Christian Youth Association . There was no known motive for the attack . <p> Camera crews from the TV stations followed students from their buses to the school doors , asking about Marcel and getting close-ups of the most distraught . At the beginning of second period , the principal came on the PA system and said that crisis counselors were available for those who wished to speak to them . Any students who felt unable to continue with their classes that day were to . be excused . <p> Garvey Banks looked over at his girlfriend , Tiffany . Neither of them had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't anything happening at school except people crying and carrying on . When he nodded toward the door , she smiled in that special way of hers and gathered her books and collected a pass from the teacher . Garvey waited a few minutes , then followed her outside . <p> They walked up to Bickel Park and sat on a bench overlooking the pond . Two old white ladies were throwing bread to the ducks . The wet grass steamed in the sun . Tiffany put her head on Garvey 's shoulder and hummed to herself . Garvey wanted to feel sad over that boy getting killed , but it was good being warm like this and close to Tiffany . <p> They sat on the bench in the sun . They did n't talk . They hardly ever talked . Tiffany liked to look at things and be quiet in herself . Pretty soon they 'd rent a movie and go over to Garvey 's . They 'd kiss . They would n't take any chances , but they 'd make each other happy . All of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait for it . <p> After a while , Tiffany stopped humming . " Ready , Gar ? " <p> " Ready . " <p> They stopped in at Gold 's Video and Garvey took Breakfast at Tiffany 's off the shelf . They rented it the first time because of the title , then it became their favorite movie . Someday , they were going to live in New York City and low all kinds of people-that was for sure . <p> Mr. Gold was slow writing up the receipt . He looked sick . He counted out Garvey 's change and said , " Why are n't you kids in school ? " <p> Garvey felt cornered and decided to blow a little smoke at the man . " Friend of mine got killed , " he said . <p> " You knew him ? You knew Marcel Foley ? " <p> " Yes , sir . From way back . " <p> " What was he like ? " <p> " Marcel ? Hey , Marcel was the best . You got a problem , you took it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or whatever . Trouble at home . Trouble with a friend . Marcel had this thing -- right , Tiff ? -- he could bring people together . He just had this easy way , and he talked to you like you were important , like everybody 's important . He could get people to come together , know what I 'm saying ? Come together and get on with it . Peacemaker . Marcel was a peacemaker . And that 's the best thing you can be . " <p> " Yes , " Mr. Gold said . " It is . " He put his hands on the counter and lowered his head . <p> Then Garvey saw that he was grieving , and it came to him how unfair a thing it was that Marcel Foley had been struck down with his life . still before him , all his sunny days stolen away . It was wrong , and Garvey knew that it would not end there . He touched Mr. Gold 's shoulder . " That man 'll get his , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . " <p> 
##1003707 IMAGINE , INSTEAD , THAT HE HAD N'T DIED . NOT , anyway , in the manner the newspapers reported , writer lying prostrate on the floor of Sheilah Graham 's apartment , still clutching The Princeton Alumni Weekly . A heart attack is not necessarily fatal , and he was only fort-four . Much better , truer , to conceive him as going on , recovering . There was a doctor in Hollywood he had come , vaguely , to trust . Suppose this doctor had , in no uncertain terms , cautioned him against the ravaged life he had been living , and as a result , Scott Fitzgerald had made a change , resolution , and before the California winter was even half done , boarded a train headed not for New York but for Baltimore . <p> Imagine him then making the long southwestern rail loop , bottles of club soda at his feet . Already , good habits are playing havoc with his system . On the train , he alternates between gloom and a billowing strange hope . He is going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he knows , still , very few people , where he will fulfill his promise . He has decided all this , made himself sober on it . He purchases coffee , and somewhere between Albuquerque and the Texas border , experiences one of those false highs , brought on by a combination of sleeplesness and the caffeine rush , in which his own future seems , again , bright . He has been in Hollywood too long , that is all , trying to earn money , trying to earn a screen credit , being fed humiliation along with an increasingly long series of memos from Joseph L. Mankiewicz . It is some kind of miracle that he can still do this , still inhabit the sense that great things might yet be accomplished . He rides with the feeling for several miles , then places his hands , unconsciously , against his breast . A moment later , he smiles , understanding this , correctly , to be a cautioning gesture . Above him , in a box resting on the luggage rack , is the manuscript , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , The Last Tycoon . He takes the box down , holds it in his lap , does n't open it . The texture of the box is smooth , and he runs his hands back and forth over it . " Cut the rest away , " he thinks to himself , and , inside , believes he can hear the snap , the severance from all that has been difficult , and pretends that he is twenty years old again , on fire with the ambition to be a novelist . <p> THE DOCTOR WHO HAD SAVED HIS LIFE WAS A WIRY MAN who resembled the character actor Allyn Joslyn . Perhaps you do n't remember Josyln . He marched , pale and moonfaced , through a thousand supporting parts . He was the rejected suitor , disconsolate in a tuxedo , outshone even by the likes of Brian Donlevy . This sort of thing , the doubleness of Hollywood , the resemblance of people to other people , always caught by surprise , and when the doctor said the one thing he really ought to have heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've taken a look at your heart , and it 's a curious thing " was what the doctor had said . " If I had to describe it , I 'd say there are etchings on lines made , well , like with a penknife . " Then , because the doctor had a trade of writers and considered himself , too , something of a literary man , he could n't resist adding a flourish : " It 's like someone 's been writing with a sharp instrument on your heart . " <p> On the table , shirtless , Scott had stared out the window and seen a woman on the sidewalk , looking first way , then that . <p> " So your advice , " he had swallowed , gotten over something lumpish in his throat , " is to cut out the drinking . " <p> " And the smoking . " <p> " Yes . " <p> " And walk . For God 's sake , walk . " <p> It was what he did now , in the city of Baltimore , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After his work was done , instead of reaching for the bottle and the handy daily abuse of Zelda and whoever happened to be visiting , he took a long gentleman 's stroll to Mount Vernon Square , sat like a pensioned officer among the statues , and listened for some bothersome , incorrect phrase from his novel to surface . He limited himself to thoughts of craft , erected a wall against the vast , airy other side of life . Then , because of the cold , he got up and walked briskly , all the way to the Quaker School at the end of his own block , on Park Avenue . There , he sat on a bench and waited or the children to be dismissed . <p> This became a daily ritual and the thing he looked forward to the most . At four o'clock , a bell rang , a matron came and opened the gates . The boys rushed out and the girls , walking slowly , wearing hats , had to endure frequent taunts and pushes from the boys . Occasionally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stopped in her tracks to face down her tormentor . A daily game ; he enjoyed watching it . At her post by the gate , the matron stood with pursed , alert lips . The girl was no-nonsense , however , and was never dragged into a fight . The boys spoke , yelled , begged entry into the hot , intimate circle of her attention , but she turned on her heels and soon enough they all disappeared , boys and girls , around corners , toward homes ; the matron locked the gate . It was that bereft time of day , after writing , between rituals , when the temper of everything darkened and he thought of Zelda in Montgomery , released from hospital into her mother 's care . <p> It was not a thing he wanted to be thinking of ; it went contrary to his plans for himself -- those good plans -- so in the evenings he tried to distract his thoughts by going to the movies . It happened to be a decent season for American entertainment : Kitty Foyle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught only half a movie . For the other half of the time , he studied men 's faces . Ginger Rogers came on the screen and the men took on a sleepy look , underneath which was the most intense scrutiny . It was marvelous to watch . His excuse for his own absorption in the lives of other men was the novel he was writing : He told himself he was only behaving like his hero , Monroe Stahr , a man making a conscious effort to drop away from ambition , to become like those men who simply go out in search of love . It was no good , though , as an excuse ; the novel had taken on a life of its own . Something else , something closer to him , was at work . He as afraid of it , and gave it other names . <p> There were nights when he followed young men in their after-movie wanderings . Most nights he was disappointed ; the young man he had chosen to follow simply went home . But one night he got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the harbor . The man was heavy , unattractive , thick in the legs , and wore a brown suit . Also a hat , pulled low . He walked with determination , at the same time hesitantly , as if he might reach his destination at any moment . There was fog , dampness in the air . Now the man had stopped ; that is , his body had come to rest in a charged but absolutely still manner . Across the street , a woman stood under a streetlamp , looking like she was waiting for a bus . Of course she was n't , but there as still the illusion , beautifully maintained , that at any second she would take out a purse and begin counting her change . Her hat , he could see from this distance , as felt , perhaps gray , and hugged her head like a loose fist . The man continued to study her , then moved across the street . It took Scott several seconds to catch up with the movement . By then they were impossibly close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The woman looked up , as if helpless under an assault . The backs of her knees wobbled . The man 's hand had gone out and begun stroking her shoulder and arm . Soon they would go inside somewhere and continue , and the act , as he imagined it , took on a bitter seriousness that evoked in him an acute form of envy . <p> He went home and masturbated . He placed himself over the toilet on the second floor , standing . No fantasy attached to this , but he did close his eyes and felt his lips form a word he did not immediately recognize . A moment or two after discharging , he was overcome by a fit of self-loathing and remembered how Zelda had told him he was somehow , mysteriously , less than other me He had long since ceased to attach to this thoughts of length and girth ; she meant , he was certain , something else . He mastered himself , he flushed , he went and lay on the bed . Baltimore was in darkness . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street imposed itself like a thumb against the sky . He felt for his heart and recalled then , with sudden clarity and as if hearing them for the first time , the doctor 's words . Someone had written on this organ of his . There were words , sentences . If he pressed hard enough , he imagined he could feel the raised bumps on his ventricles and read what was written there , which must be truth , and which would tell him the next thing to do .. <p> But all he could feel was a stubborn beating , as if his heart had determined not to know anything , but merely to go on . <p> SOON AFTER , HE BEGAN WRITING TO ZELDA . EVERY day , as soon as he finished work on the novel , and before the walk , the same words . " Dear Zelda , " and then something inconsequential . Here 's how the writing 's going . Here 's what Baltimore looks like in the snow . He was after something , though its exact shape and form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild impulsive acts set against the order and duty of his new life , and he wondered about their power to disrupt everything all over again . Still , it disturbed him to read her stiff , careful replies , which implied she had not been unsettled by his letters at all . They arrived , her replies , on perfumed stationery . He lifted them to his nose and smelled her mother 's house , the brocade furniture and photographs on the walls , all the entrapment from which he had sprung her once , a young man in a uniform in the southern night . Or not exactly sprung her ( he needed to release himself from his own mythology ) : It had rather seemed , in the Montgomery nights and for several years after , that life could be lived solely on the terms of promise . Now here was something else . A man with thinning hair sitting alone in a Baltimore townhouse , a woman recovering from madness on her mother 's porch . <p> In her replies , Scott decided , Zelda was simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of feeling , which had become for him , in the moment , necessary to explore . Yet what did he expect ? " Your mother and I write to each other , " he wrote his daughter , Scottie , at Vassar , " like people who have danced once at the junior-class cotillion and do n't want to presume too much of the acquaintance . " <p> Then one day he found himself smashing past the formality . " Did we love each other he wrote to Zelda . " I wonder now . I think of the summer of 1918 , who I was then , what I wanted , the long approach to the house on Pleasant Avenue .... " He put the pen down . It was an awful start . But he recognized , at least , that an impediment had been pushed past . But that word love . He turned it around in his mind , uncertain whether it was the true thing he was after . It was late , he was tired , he finished the letter and mailed it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray pallor hung over Baltimore , the same gray pallor that had lingered now for a week . He went into the cathedral , looked at statues . Did we love each other ? The oddness of the question haunted him , because on one level it did n't matter , they were separate now . Yet it was part of what had happened to him , this gift of continued life he 'd been given , to want to make sense of the past : love , sex , things he had failed to understand . The young officer and the debutante , the romance of it , giving way to a man in Baltimore Cathedral , wondering whether he had been , of all things , fair . An hour passed , then he got up and went back to his study and began another letter . The question , he had decided , was important after all . At least , unavoidable . Toward the end of his life , a man seeks to undo the damage he has caused . It was an old story , archaic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit annoyed , to find himself inside it now . With this next letter , he began the overtures , the suggestions that the doctors at Johns Hopkins and Sheppard Pratt might be able to attend to Zelda as well as the ones in Montgomery . <p> ZELDA ARRIVED LATE IN THE SPRING , NERVOUS ( IT had not been easy , but an effort , to get her here , letters back and forth over two months ) , and when she . stepped down from the train he saw an old woman . Hesitant , he touched his nose and waved . They looked at each other like that for several seconds in Penn Station . Strangely , there was not a sense of the past , of all that had preceded this meeting , but of the simple , clamoring noise of the present -- steam , and the rough energy of an American railway station at midday , the surprisingly conventional clothes each of them wore . The moment seemed curiously thin , most routine . Zelda 's sister rushed up from behind , all bustle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her forward as if uncertain she would , at the last instant , turn her charge over to this man who had done , already , so much harm . <p> They had lunch at the Belvedere . Zelda , cold , kept her coat on . Rosalind , the sister , sat like a woman petting a dog in her lap . Rosalind adopted a slouch and eyed Scott as if waiting for him to spill his drink . It happened to be club soda with a sliver of lime , but he suspected that , if given a chance , she 'd sniff it for evidence of gin . This was an old , old scene among the three of them , and it would be over soon . After three days of settling in , of talking to the doctors at Sheppard Pratt and making sure that all the many things Scott had attended to for years would in fact be taken care of ( and she approached this as if everything about Zelda 's maintenance would be new to him , all the familiar things need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train and urge the wheels forward with her brittle worry . <p> Finally , the day arrived . He introduced Zelda to his customs . " I write between these hours , " and so forth . " It 's all right , " she answered . Her smile struck him as the smile of a woman attempting to hide a broken heart . Had she expected something more ? It was soon clear she had not . She took out her Bible and settled into a comfortable chair near a window . Every once in a while , he interrupted his writing and opened the door a crack . Zelda appeared placid , staring out at the yards and the rooftops of Bolton Hill . Returning to his desk , he felt the loss of tension : It was hard to go back to Monroe Stahr after watching Zelda . He found himself , instead , a room away , listening for her every move . For an hour , he traced doodles in the margin of the paper before him , he attempted to write a graceful sentence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk to Mount Vernon Square , to the Quaker School . " Look , " he said , pointing out his favorite among the students . " Look at that one . " Distracted , she blinked , tried to focus , missed what he had pointed out . He took her by the elbow , led her home . The nap of her coat felt thin , the coat itself unstylish , and when he looked at Zelda 's face it seemed he himself was twenty-four years old , but that she had aged at a speed and in a dimension foreign to him . <p> That night , the first of their solitude , he sat in the hard-backed chair by her bed and watched her undress . In the later years of their marriage , it had not been their custom to undress in front of each other , but in the dark . So his staring made her overcautious , not sure which button her fingers ought next go to , and she asked him to turn off the light . " Why ? " he replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Because I 'm embarrassed , " she lied . But he , in his chair , was merely waiting , patient , determined not to blink , in spite of what a wreck life may have made of her body in the time of his absence . <p> " Ignore me , " he said . <p> She proceeded , was naked only briefly . He was startled , and nearly turned away , but forced himself to look . This was not Zelda ; this was a woman he did n't know . He felt ashamed for her . It was inconceivable that he had coupled with her , her skin had housed his child . Her skin had gone spotty , there were folds , the breasts hung with a suggestion of illness , and it was all pale , abnormally so . She sat on the side of the bed . In her lap was the white nightgown , while below , he could just make out the tawny bush between her legs . For a moment , he lifted his eyes and stared out at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and compacted glow of the scene tried to recover an ancient sense of life 's romance . <p> In the silence of the room , he understood that she was talking . <p> " Will we sleep in the same bed ? " she asked . <p> ( Until now , she and Rosalind had shared the bed , he 'd taken a sofa downstairs . ) <p> " Of course . " He nodded , to back it up . They had nor had sex in years , sex as quite impossible . <p> " Wo n't that ... " She did n't finish . <p> She put on her nightgown and lay back , covered herself with the sheet and blanket . <p> It was too much that he should make the same display of himself . Nor did she ask . Once , as young people , they had paraded naked before each other in expensive hotels , though always a little shy . It was one with the silliness of who they had been , the way they had gone about things . The couple on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Briefly , the most envied couple in America . Sometimes , during fights , he had reminded her of that small fact . <p> Now he turned off the lights and undressed . He folded his clothes and coughed twice . <p> " Your heart , how is it ? " she asked out of the dark . <p> Written on . Scourged Impaled on a stake . <p> " I 'm expected to live , " he said lightly . He climbed in next to her , in pajamas . From her side , a heat rose . It was like a mild opening scene between Robert Montgomery and Carole Lombard . Soon , something would happen , he was sure , though what it was , what turn it would take , comic or tragic , this was the uncertain element . He was , in any case , far from sleep . She had taken pills to help her . The wild stirrings of the Baltimore spring approached the window , which rattled . Thinking her asleep , he got up to close it , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Strange , " she said , and he waited . " To be here . " <p> SOON THEY HAD CUSTOMS , AN ORDINARY COUPLE 'S religion of habits . They ate at the proper times and cut their food carefully and stared out the windows of the modest restaurants they frequented . Once they would have torn apart their fellow diners , the pretentious hats , the ridiculous silent men , but now they took them in and said nothing , aware that they were as ridiculous as anyone else . An older couple , anxious as to the prices , sharing only the tiniest bits of information in place of conversation , declining dessert . It took an abnormally long time for Zelda to get out of her seat , to slip her spring coat on . Scott took a toothpick and waited . He watched their habits descend to those of a class he had once scorned , and did n't seem to mind . The first exposure to the evening air was tonic . <p> Their lives could almost be said to be regular ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And madness was a thing that came and went . You could believe , for long passages of time , that it was not important . Then a streetcar would make a rude noise and Zelda , clinging to him , would have to be brought home , and any plans they 'd made for the evening canceled . <p> Still , madness had been with them so long it had begun to give way to a form of nostalgia . Zelda asked , for instance , one Saturday , if they might go walking on the grounds of Sheppard Pratt , where she had once tried to throw herself in front of a train . She insisted on following certain paths . He was struck , moved even , by what she was doing , by the intent , nearly distorted cast of her features as she sounded out some inner declivity , worked it the way a tongue does a missing tooth . Madness had altered , for her , the map of the world . It as this that touched him , the privacy of it , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topography , on the old cow paths of the institution . <p> In the summer he bought a car , cheap , barely functional , but enough to get them out into the country during weekends . Baltimore was hot , and they had not much money . Collier 's had bought serialization rights to The Last Tycoon , though at an embarrassingly low figure . And there was Scottie at Vassar . Still , the WPA had seen fit to accommodate them : There were parks in Maryland where Zelda might rest her head against his stomach for an hour or two and sleep . These were his happiest moments . He kept bankers ' hours now , felt no compulsion to work on Saturdays and Sundays . Monroe Stahr was safely on a plane that would crash ; Scott could see his hero 's demise arriving on a set of graded steps , to be trod on lightly . Scottie arrived late in June , freed from school , to stay for a week . He abandoned the bed , allowed the women to sleep wrapped in each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under the single lamp of the kitchen , they plucked strawberries from a carton , Scott in his shirtsleeves , Zelda laughing . To his agent , Harold Ober , he wrote , " I am remaking it all , just as if there were never pain and shame involved . Do n't believe me ? You would if you could look in our window , on the nights when I 'm generous and walk down to the corner to bring back ice cream . We are a cozy little family , except , of course , for our ghosts . " <p> During the evenings of Scottie 's stay , as he lay on the downstairs sofa trying to hold onto consciousness an extra few minutes , simply to relish that much longer the state of his family at rest , the ghosts that visited him were mostly fictional ones , and it occurred to him that he had outlived them all . Dick Diver had been last seen driving from town to town , isolated and in decline , Jay Gatsby left lying facedown in a pool . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descent from the cloud-capped tower . The world of the in-between had been peripheral , George Wilson 's days of fixing cars while Myrtle screwed Tom Buchanan . He found now that he had to adjust his sense of identification . He was becoming like his own secondary characters , those for whom it was enough to imply hold on . <p> THE NICE THING , OF COURSE , WOULD BE TO SIMPLY accept what had been presented to him and settle in , but he found in himself , on even the happiest of his nights , the seeds of resistance , and wondered when they might sprout . In a note to his publisher describing The Last Tycoon , he had written about Monroe Stahr , " He has had everything in life except the privilege of giving himself unselfishly to another human being , " and it was this that he considered his own noble purpose in having brought Zelda back from the dead . It worked , to a degree , so long as he was writing . But there came a day early in September when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , at least at the beginning . In the post office , be hesitated , and looked into the clerk 's eyes , trying to offer this heavy , good-looking young man an indication of the triumph he felt . <p> The clerk smiled , indulged him a moment , then looked to the next person in line . Scott lit a cigarette , hesitant to leave . A mural lay against the great wall of the post office . In a movie , the camera would have drawn back and taken all this in : the great writer lost in the crowd , the cigarette smoke , the mural . Then the package on its conveyor belt , going on to Scribner 's . Until suddenly , drawn back into close-up , inhaling the pleasant smoke ( against doctor 's orders , but the book , after all , was finished ) , he was struck by the emptiness of his situation : the novel sent off , the day yawning before him , and all the energy he had learned to harness and put to use struggling inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the townhouse , where Zelda was resting at midmorning . " We 'll take a drive , " he said , distracted , annoyed now by the simple presence of her . <p> " Where ? " she wanted to know . <p> " I have n't seen my father 's grave . " <p> This was not strictly true : He had seen it , but not visited it since his father 's burial ten years ago . The old man was in the Catholic cemetery in Rockville , fifty miles distant . It was a destination , a place to go . There was no more to his suggestion than that , at least not at first , but she looked at him as if there were . He fidgeted in his chair , breathed out heavily , put his hand on his chest , reconsidered . But by then , she had already got up to dress . <p> The day was hot . A street was being repaired , a small parade passed : It was difficult getting out of Baltimore , and if the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by himself , savoring his triumph alone . He felt an impulse , a wild desire -- not new , certainly , but not for a while this vivid -- to say cruel things to Zelda . They idled in the city heat . Zelda said nothing and may have been praying silently . It occurred to him that he could rip her dress without thinking . He could expose her there , in the car , for everyone to see , and stand in his seat and point at her sickly breasts and shout : " You think I love those ? Anyone ? My life has been a colossal mistake " Such actions seemed merely a half step away . <p> Finally , traffic moved . A breeze helped matters . <p> " Say something , " he said to Zelda . " Say any damn thing . " <p> She glanced at him , and , sensing danger , closed her eyes , slept awhile . He drove . Arbutus . Relay . Horses raced in the depths of the Maryland countryside and the hotels : resembled Selznick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were more inviting . He 'd completed his best novel , his hardest and toughest . It would be all right certainly , today only , to let go . But he had this woman beside him and he was remembering -- forcing himself to , anyway -- the last time he had let go with her , in Cuba , when she 'd ended up locked in a room , praying , while he 'd nearly had his eye taken out in a fight . Or had that been later , another time ? He fought the seduction , swallowed hard , drove . But it seemed too cruel a punishment , to have finished and to be facing only sobriety , dullness , ruin . Would she like to read to him from her Bible ? The Book : of Ruth , perhaps ? He felt , in is imagination , the sting of his hand against those cheeks , slapping her back into life . She as intent on hiding from him , and he wanted something , suddenly very badly , if not from her then from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The establishment was located at the top of a hill ; behind it , the land fell off sharply . There was a wide circle for cars . He heard water somewhere not far off . Zelda awoke . She stared at the building , seemed to know what it was . Her anxiety took the form of scratching her knee . <p> Scott opened the door and got out . <p> He stood by the fender , lifted his shoe , looked at her . He was concerned with a coupe of sentences in the book , wanted to call it back , would wait for Perkins 's reply . Zelda would not look at him now . That being the case ( had he stopped here only to test her ? ) , he was going in to have a drink , one or two . More . There was no end to what he imagined . That was tomorrow , and the next day , what would he do ? He touched the warm hood of the car . She turned to him . <p> Stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a moment then when she looked at him in the old way . A reservoir of feeling opened . But she could n't hold it , or his gaze . It had given him fuel , though ; in his mind 's eye , he saw the battle he must have now , must , which would involve going in and getting drunk and maligning her to the bartender until he was thrown out , and then he would say the same hateful things to her , until someone drove them home or beat him up or did something to end it . And he must do this , he must hate her , though it had begun to seem to him , standing there , a source of infinite mystery that this old , pale woman in the car should require from him punishment so severe . <p> " I should tell you that I 'm going to write to Rosalind to come and get me , " she said , and it had a kind of debutante pout to it , something recovered from deep in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would say next . <p> He came around and opened the door of the car . <p> " Get out , " he said . <p> She did n't like the way he looked , the red around his temples , the manner in which he was clutching himself near the armpit . <p> " You should n't ... " <p> " I do n't care what I should n't be doing , " he said . <p> He thought the line was melodramatic . He was dragging her into the woods . He imagined how they must look , how she must look , in the dress she had worn , gussying herself up as if for some occasion . He had no idea what his intention was except that there was nothing after it , nothing he could see , anyway . He wanted to be finished with her just as he had finished the book . The two had gone together , always , and he believed now , was certain ( and wanted to punish himself for it ) , that it had been , after all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing more . <p> Then they were in the woods , and stood there , facing the trickling brook , which was not much , and which flowed at a considerable distance down the hill . Around them were wild strawberries , blue flowers , acorns , the pale growth of late summer . He was holding her hand , and in the gesture there was still the potential for violence , though it had lessened -- he could n't remember suddenly what he had brought her here for , or . what he intended to do . She might not have known , though , that she was safe , because she fell against him , as a way , he thought , of escaping his grasp . She fell like a woman collapsing under the force of a man 's passion . It was impossible then , from the way she lay on the ground , the way her legs fell , that their old sex should n't have reared its head . For a moment , neither of them looked away from it , but locked eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he thought , as it did so , that it was a thing -- not the sex itself , but the charge out of which it had sprung -- that neither of them would ever outgrow . <p> Finally , Zelda closed her eyes and wished it away . In the moments afterward , he was left with it , with the summation of feeling as real a companion as he could imagine . <p> Calm now , the air and everything it carried seemed held in abeyance , as if waiting for him to acknowledge what was left to be acknowledged . He touched his scalp , felt the thinness of the skin , the thick veins pressing against it . How long before a repetition of the revolt of the heart ? He rested two fingers on Zelda 's forehead . He would let her sleep , then they would get up , brush each other 's clothes off , and continue on the ride to Rockville . There , he would clear whatever dead growth was to be found around his father 's grave , freshen the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officious , in place of a prayer . The words on his heart , which had leaped up in the moments before , as Zelda lay below him , retreated then , having not quite allowed themselves to be read . They would to be sure , have been too banal to speak . He remembered , instead , a day at Cap d'Antibes , the water of the Mediterranean , his hand on his lee , and Scottie close , and Zelda . Someone was taking their photograph , he remembered now . They had held their poses a long time , not out of happiness certainly . There are one or two moments to which one remains true . One neither moves from them nor retreats . He ran his hand up and over Zelda 's forehead and said , with his hand , Now rest . <p> 
##1003708 ALL THE PREVIOUS DAY , THEY HAD BEEN tacking up from the Grenadines , bound for Martinique to return the boat and take leave of Freycinet . Bellington was trying to forget the anxieties of the deal , the stink of menace , the sick ache behind the eyes . It was dreadful to have to smoke with the St. Vincentian dealers , some killers who liked to operate from behind a thin film of fear . But the Frenchman was tough . <p> Off Dark Head there was a near thing with a barge under tow . Blessington , stoned at the wheel , his glass of straight Demerara beside the binnacle , had calmly watched a dimly lighted tug struggle past on a parallel course at a distance of a mile or so . The moon was newly risen , out of sight behind the island 's mountains , silvering the line of the lower slopes . A haze of starlight left the sea in darkness , black as the pit , now and then flashing phosphorescence . They were at least ten miles offshore . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steered the big ketch a little farther off the wind , gliding toward the trail of living light in the tug 's wake . Only in the last second did the dime drop : he took a quick look over his shoulder . And of course there came the barge against the moon-traced mountains , a big black homicidal juggernaut , unmarked and utterly unlighted , bearing down on them . Bellington swore and spun the wheel like Ezekiel , as hard to port as it went , thinking that if his keel was over the cable nothing would save them , that 360 degrees of helm or horizon would be less than enough to escape by . <p> Then everything not secured came crashing down on everything else , the tables and chairs on the after-deck went over , plates and bottles smashed , whatever was breakable immediately broke . The boat , the Sans Regret , fell off the wind like a comedian and flapped into a flying jibe . A couple of yards to starboard the big barge raced past like a silent freight train , betrayed only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It might have been no more than the wind for all you could hear of it . When it was safely gone , the day 's fear welled up again and gagged him . <p> The Frenchman ran out on deck cursing and looked to the cockpit , where Blessington had the helm . His hair was cut close to his skull . He showed his teeth in the mast light . He was brushing his shorts ; something had spilled in his lap . <p> " Qu'est-ce que c'est la ? " he demanded of Blessington . Blessington pointed into the darkness where the barge had disappeared . The Frenchman knew only enough of the ocean to fear the people on it . " Quel cul " he said savagely . " Who is it ? " He was afraid of the Coast Guard and of pirates . <p> " We just missed being sunk by a barge . No lights . Submerged cable . It 's okay now . " <p> " Fuck , " said the Frenchman , Freycinet . " Why are you stopping ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Freycinet was under the impression that because the boat had lost its forward motion they were stopping , as though he had applied a brake . Freycinet had been around boats long enough to know better . He must be out of his mind , Blessington thought . <p> " I 'm not stopping , Honor . We 're all right . " <p> " I bust my fucking ass below , " said Freycinet . " Marie fall out of bed . " <p> Tough shit , thought Blessington . Be thankful you 're not treading water in the splinters of our stupidly named boat . " Sorry , man , " he said . <p> Sans Regret , with its fatal echoes of Piaf . The Americans might be culturally deprived , Blessington thought , but surely every cutter in the Yankee Coast Guard would have the sense to board that one . And the cabin stank of the resiny ganja they had stashed , along with the blow , under the cabin sole . No amount of roach spray or air freshener could cut it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went below without further complaint , missing in his ignorance the opportunity to abuse Blessington at length . It had been Blessington 's fault they had not seen the barge sooner , stoned and drunk as he was . He should have looked for it as soon as the tug went by . To stay awake through the night he had taken crystal and his peripheral vision was flashing him little mongoose darts , shooting stars composed of random light . Off the north shore of St. Vincent , the winds were murder . <p> Just before sunrise , he saw the Pitons rising from the sea off the starboard bow , the southwest coast of St. Lucia . Against the pink sky , the two peaks looked like a single mountain . It was hard to take them for anything but a good omen . As the sudden dawn caught fire , they turned green with hope . So many hearts , he thought , must have lifted at the sight of them . <p> To Blessington , they looked like the beginning of home free . Or at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could return the boat and Blessington could take his portion and be off to America on his student visa . He had a letter of acceptance from a hotel-management school in Florida but his dream was to open a restaurant in the Keys . <p> He took another deep draft of the rum to cut the continuing anxieties . The first sunlight raised a sweat on him , so he took his shirt off and put on his baseball hat . Florida Marlins . <p> Freycinet came out on deck while he was having a drink . <p> " You 're a drunk Irishman , " Freycinet told him . <p> " That I 'm not , " said Blessington . It seemed to him no matter how much he drank he would never be drunk again . The three Vincentians had sobered him for life He had been sitting on the porch of the guesthouse on Canouan when they walked up . They had approached like panthers , no metaphor , no politics intended . Their every move was a dark roll of musculature , balanced and wary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blessington had been reclining , tilted backward in a cane chair with his feet on the porch rail , when they came up to him . <p> " Frenchy ? " one had asked very softly . <p> Blessington had learned the way of hard men back in Ireland and thought he could deal with them . He had been careful to maintain his relaxed position . <p> " I know the man you mean , sir , " he had said . " But I 'm not him , see . You 'll have to wait . " <p> At Blessington 's innocuous words they had tensed in every fiber , although you had to be looking right at them to appreciate the physics of it . They drew themselves up around their hidden weaponry behind a silent , drug-glazed wall of suspicion that looked impermeable to reason . They were zombies , without mercy , and he , Blessington , was wasting their time . He resolved to count to thirty but at the count often he took his feet down off the rail . <p> Freycinet turned and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Pitons delighted him . <p> " Ah , la C'est les Pitons , n'est-ce pas ? " <p> " Oui , " said Blessington . " Les Pitons . " They had gone south in darkness and Freycinet had never seen them before . <p> The wind shifted to its regular quarter and he had a hard time tacking level with the island . The two women came out on deck . Freycinet 's Marie was blond and very young . She came from Normandy and she had been a waitress in the bistro outside Fort-de-France , where Freycinet and Blessington cooked . Sometimes she seemed so sunny and innocent that it was hard to connect her with a hood like Freycinet . At other times she seemed very knowing indeed . It was hard to tell , she was so often stoned . <p> Gillian was an American from Texas . She had a hard , thin face with a prominent nose and a big jaw . Her father , Blessington imagined , was one of those Texans , a tough , loud man who cursed the Mexicans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very long legs . Her slenderness and height and interesting face had taken her into modeling , to Paris and Milan . In contrast , she had muscular thighs and a big derriere , which , if it distressed the couturiers , made her more desirable . She was Blessington 's designated girlfriend on the trip but they rarely made love because , influenced by the others , he had taken an early dislike to her . He supposed she knew it . <p> " Oh , wow , " she said in her Texas voice , " look at those pretty mountains . " <p> It was exactly the kind of American comment that made the others all despise and imitate her -- even Marie , who had no English at all . Gillian had come on deck stark naked , and each of them , the Occitan Freycinet , Norman Marie , and Irish Blessington , felt scornful and slightly offended . Anyone else might have been forgiven . They had decided she was a type and she could do no right . <p> Back on Canouan , Gillian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At first , when everyone smoked in the safe house , they had paid no attention to the women . The deal was repeated to everyone 's satisfaction . As the dealers gave forth their odor of menace Marie had skillfully disappeared herself in plain view . But Gillian , to Blessington 's humiliation and alarm , had put out a ray and one of the men had called her on it . <p> Madness . n a situation so volatile , so bloody fraught . But she was full of lusts , was Texan Gillian , and physically courageous , too . He noticed she whined less than the others , in spite of her irritating accent . It had ended with her following the big St. Vincentian to her guesthouse room , walking ten paces behind with her eyes down , making herself a prisoner , a lamb for the slaughter . <p> For a while Blessington had thought she would have to do all three of them but it had been only the one , Nigel . Nigel had returned her to Blessington in a grim little ceremony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twisted tight around her neck . <p> " Wan ' have she back , mon ? " <p> Leaving Blessington with the problem of how to react . The big bastard was fucking welcome to her but of course it would have been tactless to say so . Should he protest and get everyone killed ? Or should he be complacent and be thought a pussy and possibly achieve the same result ? It was hard to find a middle ground but Blessington found one , a tacit , ironic posture , fashioned of silences and body language . The Irish had been a subject race , too , after all . <p> " I gon ' to make you a present , mon . Give you little pink piggy back . Goodness of my ha'art . " <p> So saying , Nigel had put his huge busted-knuckle hand against her pale hard face and she had looked down submissively , trembling a little , knowing not to smile . Afterward , she was very cool about it . Nigel had given her a little Rasta bracelet , beads in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Think I 'm a pink piggy , Liam ? " <p> He had not been remotely amused and he had told her so . <p> So she had walked on ahead laughing and put her palms together and looked up to the sky and said , " Oh , my Lord " And then glanced at him and wiped the smile off her face . Plainly she 'd enjoyed it , all of it . She wore the bracelet constantly . <p> Now she leaned on her elbows against the chart table with her bare bum thrust out , turning the bracelet with the long , bony fingers of her right hand . Though often on deck , she seemed never to burn or tan . A pale child of night was Gillian . <p> " What island you say that was ? " she asked . <p> " It 's St. Lucia , " Blessington told her . " The mountains are called the Pitons . " <p> " The Pee-tuns ? Does that mean something cool in French ? " She turned to Blessington , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Freycinet made an unpleasant , ratty face . He was ugly as cat shit , Blessington thought , something Gillian doubtless appreciated . He had huge soulful brown eyes and a pointed nose like a puppet 's . His military haircut showed the flattened shape of his skull . <p> " It means stakes , " Blessington said . <p> " Steaks ? Like ... " <p> " Sticks , " said Blessington . " Rods . Palings . " <p> " Oh , " she said , " stakes . Like Joan of Arc got burned at , right ? " <p> Freycinet 's mouth fell open . Marie laughed loudly . Gillian looked slyly at Blessington . <p> " Honore , " she said . " Tu es un dindon . You 're a dindon , man . I 'm shitting you . I understand French fine . " <p> It had become amusing to watch her tease and confound Freycinet . Dangerous work and she did it cleverly , leaving the Frenchman to marvel at the depths of her stupidity until paranoia infected his own self-confidence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting to see the point of her . <p> " I mean , I worked the Paris openings for five years straight . I told you that . " <p> Drunk and stoned as the rest of them , Gillian eventually withdrew from the ascending spring sun . Marie went down after her . Freycinet 's pointed nose was out of joint . <p> " You hear what she say ? " he asked Blessington . " That she speak French all the time ? What the fuck ? Because she said before , ' Non , I do n't speak it . ' Now she 's speaking it . " <p> " Ah , she 's drunk , Honore . She 's just a bimbo . " <p> " I ' ope so , eh ? " said Freycinet . He looked at the afterdeck to be sure she was out of earshot . " Because ... because what if she setting us up ? All zese time , eh ? If she 's agent . Or she 's informer ? A grass ? " <p> Blessington pondered it deeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more than a fatuous , if perverse , American . Now , the way she laughed at them , he was not at all sure . <p> " I thought she came with you . Did she put money up ? " <p> Freycinet puffed out his hollow cheeks and shrugged . <p> " She came to me from Lavigerie , " he said . The man who called himself Lavigerie was a French-Israeli of North African origin , a hustler in Fort-de-France . " She put in money , oui . The same as everyone . " <p> They had all pooled their money for the boat and to pay the Vincentians . Blessington had invested $20,000 , partly his savings from the bistro , partly borrowed from his sister and her husband in Providence . He expected to rake it back many times over and pay them off with interest . <p> " Twenty thousand ? " <p> " Yes . Twenty . " <p> " Well , even the Americans would n't spend $20,000 to catch us , " he told Honor . " We 're too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Now I think I do n't trust her , eh ? " said Freycinet . He squinted into the sun . The Pitons , no closer , seemed to displease him now . " She 's a bitch , non ? " <p> " I think she 's all right , " Blessington said . " I really do . " <p> And for the most part he did . In any case he had decided to , because an eruption of hardcore , coke-and-speed-headed paranoia could destroy them all . It had done so to many others . Missing boats sometimes turned up on the mangrove shore of some remote island , the hulls blistered with bullet holes , cabins attended by unimaginable swarms of flies . Inside , tableaux morts not to be forgotten by the unlucky discoverer . Strong-stomached photographers recorded the tableaux for the DEA 's files , where they were stamped NOT TO BE DESTROYED , HISTORIC INTEREST . The bureau took a certain satisfaction . Blessington knew all this from his sister and her husband in Providence . <p> Now they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die at sea . In the worst of times , he grew frightened to the point of utter despair . It had bee he realized at such times , a terrible mistake . He gave up on the money . He would settle for just living , for living even in prison in France or America . Or at least for not dying on that horrible bright blue ocean , aboard the Sans Regret . <p> " Yeah , " he told Freycinet . " Hell , I would n't worry about her . Just a bimbo . " <p> All morning they tacked for the Pitons . Around noon a great crown of puffy cloud settled around Gros Piton and they were close enough to distinguish the two peaks one from the other . Freycinet refused to go below . His presence was so unpleasant that Blessington felt like weeping , knocking him unconscious , throwing him overboard , or jumping over himself . But the Frenchman remained in the cockpit though he never offered to spell Blessington at the wheel . The man drove Blessington to drink . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of crystal . A pulse fluttered under his collarbone , fear , speed . <p> Eventually , Freycinet went below . After half an hour , Gillian came topside , clothed this time , in cutoffs and a halter . The sea had picked up and she nearly lost her balance on the ladder . <p> " Steady , " said Blessington . <p> " Want a roofie , Liam ? " <p> He laughed . " A roofie ? What 's that ? Some kind of ... " <p> Gillian finished the thought he had been too much of a prude to articulate . <p> " Some kind of blow job ? Some kind of sex technique ? No , dear , it 's a medication . " <p> " I 'm on watch . " <p> She laughed at him . " You 're shit-faced is what you are . " <p> " You know , " Blessington said , you ought not to tease Honore . You 'll make him paranoid . " <p> " He 's an asshole . As we say back home . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mercurial fella . I used to work with him . " <p> " Mercurial ? If you know he 's so mercurial how come you brought him ? " <p> " I did n't bring him , " Blessington said . " He brought me . For my vaunted seamanship . And I came for the money . How about you ? " <p> " I came on account of having my brains in my ass , " she said , shaking her backside . " My talent , too . Did you know I was a barrel racer ? I play polo , too . English or Western , man , you name it . " <p> " English or Western ? " Blessington asked . <p> " Forget it , " she said . She frowned at him , smiled , frowned again . " You seem , well scared . " <p> " Ah , " said Blessington , " scared ? Yes , I am . Somewhat . " <p> " I do n't give a shit , " she said . <p> " You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I do n't care what happens . Why should I ? Me with my talent in my ass . Where do I come in ? " <p> " You should n't talk that way , " Blessington said . <p> " Fuck you . You afraid I 'll make trouble ? I assure you I could make trouble like you would n't believe . " <p> " I do n't doubt it , " Blessington said . He kept his eyes on the Pitons . His terror , he thought , probably encouraged her . <p> " Just between you and me , Liam , I have no fear of dying . I would just as soon be out here on this boat now as in my little comfy bed with my stuffed animals . I would just as soon be dead . " <p> He took another sip of rum to wet his pipes for speech . " Why did you put the money in , then ? Were n't you looking for a score ? " <p> " I do n't care about money , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kick . I thought it would be radical . But it 's just another exercise in how everything sucks . " <p> " Well , " said Blessington , " you 're right there . " <p> She looked off at the twin mountains . <p> " They do n't seem a bit closer than they did this morning . " <p> " No . It 's an upwind passage . Have to tack forever . " <p> " You know what Nigel told me back on Canouan ? " <p> " No , " Blessington said . <p> " He told me not to worry about understanding things . He said understanding was weak and lame . He said you got to overstand things . " She hauled herself and did the voice of a big St. Vincentian man saddling up a white bitch for the night , laying down wisdom . " You got to overstand it . Overstand it , right ? Funny , huh . " <p> " Maybe there 's something in it , " said Blessington . <p> " Rasta lore , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anyway , never despise what the natives tell you , that 's what my aunt used to say . Even in America . " <p> " And what was your aunt ? A dope dealer ? " <p> " She was a nun , " Blessington said . A missionary . " <p> For a while Gillian sunned herself on the foredeck , halter off . But the sun became too strong and she crawled back to the cockpit . <p> " You ever think about how it is in this part of the world ? " she asked him , " The . Caribbean and around it ? Its all suckin ' stuff they got . Suckin ' stuff , all goodies and no nourishment . " <p> " What do you mean ? " <p> " It 's all turn-ons and illusion , " she said . " Do n't you think ? Like coffee . " She numbered items on the long fingers of her left hand . " Tobacco . Emeralds . Sugar . Cocaine . Ganja . It 's all stuff you do n't need . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pogey bait . Always has been . " <p> " You 're right , " Blessington said . " Things people kill for . " <p> " Overpriced . Put together by saves and peons . Piggy stuff . For pink piggies . " <p> " I had n't thought of it , " he said . He looked over at her . She had raised a fist to her pretty mouth . " You 're clever , Gillian . " <p> " You do n't even like me , " she said . <p> " Yes I do . " <p> " Do n't you dare bullshit me . I said you do n't . " <p> " Well , ' Blessington said , " to tell you the truth at first I did n't . But now I do . " <p> " Oh , yeah ? Why ? " <p> Blessington considered before speaking . The contrary wind was picking up and there were reefs at the south end of the island . Some kind of monster tide was running against them , too . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You had me fooled , see ? Now I think you 're amusing . " <p> " Amusing ? " She seemed more surprised than angry . <p> " You really are so bloody clever , " he said , finishing the glass of rum . " When we 're together I like it . You 're not a cop , are you ? Anything like that ? " <p> " You only wish , " she said . " How about you ? " <p> " Me ? I 'm Irish , for Christ 's sake . " <p> " Is that like not being real ? " <p> " Well , " he said , " a little . In many cases . " <p> " You are scared , " she said . " You 're scared of everything . Scared of me . " <p> " Holy Christ , " said Blessington , " you 're as bad as Honore . Look , Gillian , I 'm a chef , not a pirate . I never claimed otherwise . Of course I 'm scared . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not of you , " he said . " No . Not anymore . I like you here . You 're company . " <p> " Am I ? " she asked . " Do you ? Would you marry me ? " <p> " Hey , " said Blessington . " Tomorrow . " <p> Freycinet came up on deck , looked at the Pitons , then up at Blessington and Gillian in the cockpit . <p> " Merde , " he said . " Far away still . What 's going on ? " <p> " We 're getting there , " Blessington said . " We 're closer now than we look . " <p> " Are n't the mountains pretty , . Honore ? " Gillian asked . <p> " Do n't you wish we could climb one ? " <p> Freycinet ignored her . " How long ? " he asked Blessington . <p> " To Martinique ? Tomorrow sometime , I guess . " <p> " How long before we 're off les Pitons ? " <p> " Oh , " Blessington said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll have a view . Better steer clear , though . " <p> " Marie is sick . " <p> " Poor puppy , " Gillian said . " Probably all that bug spray . Broth 's the thing . Do n't you think , Liam ? " <p> " Ya , it 's kicking up , " Blessington said . " There 's a current running and a pretty stiff offshore breeze . " <p> " Merde , " said Freycinet again . He went forward along the rail and lay down beside the anchor windlass , peering into the chains . <p> " He 's a cook , too , " Gillian said , speaking softly . " How come you 're not more like him ? " <p> " An accident of birth , " Blessington said . <p> " If we were married , " she said , " you would n't have to skip on your visa . " <p> " Ah , " said Blessington , " do n't think it has n't occurred to me . Nice to be a legal resident . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Freycinet suddenly turned and watched them . He showed them the squint , the bared canines . <p> " What you 're talking about , you two ? About me , eh ? " <p> " Damn , Honore " Gillian said . " He was just proposing . " When he had turned around again she spoke between her teeth . " Shithead is into the blow . He keeps prying up the sole . Cures Marie 's mal de mer . Keeps him on his toes . " <p> " God save us , " said Blessington . Leaning his elbow on the helm he took Gillian 's right hand and put it to her forehead , her left shoulder , and then her right one , walking through the sign of the cross . " Pray for us like a good girl . " <p> Gillian made the sign again by herself . " Shit , " she said , " now I feel a lot better . No , really , " she said when he laughed , " I do . I 'm gon na @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Om ' or ' Nam myoho renge kyo . ' " <p> They sat and watched the peaks grow closer , though the contrary current increased . <p> " When this is over , " Blessington said , " maybe we ought to stay friends . " <p> " If we 're still alive , " she said , " we might hang out together . We could go to your restaurant in the Keys . " <p> " That 's what we 'll do , " he said . " I 'll make you a sous-chef . " <p> " I 'll wait tables . " <p> " No , no . Not you . " <p> " But we wo n't be alive , " she said . <p> " But if we are . " <p> " If we are , " she said , " we 'll stay together . " She looked at him sway beside the wheel . " You better not be shitting me . " <p> " I would n't . I think it was meant to be . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Do n't make me weigh my words , Gillian . I want to say what occurs to me . " <p> " Right " she said , touching him . " when we 're together you can say any damn thing . " <p> The green mountains , in the full richness of afternoon , rose above them . Blessington had a look at the chart to check the location of the offshore reefs . He bean steering to another quarter , away from the tip of the island . <p> Gillian sat on a locker with her arms around his neck , leaning against his back . She smelled of sweat and patchouli . <p> " I 've never been with anyone as beautiful as you , Gillian . " <p> He saw she had gone to sleep . He disengaged her arms and helped her lie flat on the locker in the shifting shade of the mainsail . Life is a dream , he thought . Something she knew and I did n't . <p> I love her , Blessington thought . She encourages me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Freycinet came out on deck and called up to him . <p> " Liam We 're to stop here . Off les Pitons . " <p> " We ca n't , " Blessington said , though it was tempting . He was so tired . <p> " We have to stop . We can anchor , yes ? Marie is sick . We need to rest . We want to see them . " <p> " We 'd have to clear customs , " Blessington said . We 'll have bloody cops and boat boys and God knows what else . " <p> He realized at once what an overnight anchorage would entail . All of them up on speed or the cargo , cradling shotguns , peering into the moonlight while they waited for macheteros to come on feathered oars and steal their shit and kill them . <p> " If we anchor , " Freycinet said , " if we anchor somewhere , we wo n't have to clear . " <p> " Yes , yes , " Blessington said . " We will , sure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't hire them or buy something they 'll turn us in . " He picked up the cruising guide and waved it in the air . " It says right here you have to clear customs in Soufriere . " <p> " We 'll wait until they have close , " said Freycinet . <p> " Shit said Blessington desperately , " we 'll be fined . We 'll be boarded . " <p> Freycinet was smiling at him , a broad demented smile of infinitely self-assured contempt . Cocaine . He felt Gillian put her arm around his leg from behind . <p> " Ecoutez Liam . Ecoutez bien . We going to stop , man . We going to stop where I say . " <p> He turned laughing into the wind , gripping a stay . <p> " What did I tell you , " Gillian said softly . You wo n't have to marry me after all . ' Cause we 're dead , baby . " <p> " I do n't accept that , " Blessington said . " Take the wheel , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruising guide , he could find no anchorage that looked as though it would be out of the wind and that was not close in-shore . The only possibility was a shallow reef , near the south tip , sometimes favored by snorkeling trips , nearly three miles off the Pitons . It was in the lee of the huge peaks , its coral heads as shallow as a single fathom . The chart showed mooring floats ; presumably it was forbidden to anchor there for the sake of the coral . <p> " I beg you to reconsider , Honore , " Blessington said to Freycinet . He cleared his throat . " You 're making a mistake . " <p> Freycinet turned back to him with the same smile . <p> " Eh , Liam . You can leave , man . You know , there 's an Irish pub in Soufrere . It 's money from your friends in the IRA . You can go there , eh ? " <p> Blessington had no connection whatsoever with the IRA although he had allowed Freycinet and his friends to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can go get drunk there , " Freycinet told him and then turned again to look at the island . <p> He was standing near the bow with his bare toes caressing freeboard , gripping a stay . Blessington and Gillian exchanged looks . In the next instant she threw the wheel , the mainsail boom went crashing across the cabin roofs , the boat lurched to port and heeled hard . For a moment Freycinet was suspended over blank blue water . Blessington clambered up over the cockpit and stood swaying there for a moment , hesitating . Then he reached out for Freycinet . The Frenchman swung around the stay like a monkey and knocked him flat . The two of them went sprawling . Freycinet got to his feet in a karate stance , cursing . <p> " You shit , " he said , when his English returned . " Cunt what ? " <p> " I thought you were going over , Honore . I thought I 'd have to pull you back aboard . " <p> " That 's right , Honore , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a goner . He saved your ass , man . " <p> Freycinet pursed his lips and nodded . " Bien , " he said . He climbed down into the cockpit in a brisk , businesslike fashion and slapped Gillian across the face , backhand and forehand , turning her head around each time . <p> He gave Blessington the wheel , then he took Gillian under the arm and pulled her up out of the cockpit . " Get below I do n't want to fucking see you . " He followed her below and Blessington heard him speak briefly to Marie . The young woman began to moan . The Pitons looked close enough to strike with a rock and a rich jungle smell came out on the wind . Freycinet , back on deck , looked as though he was sniffing out menace . A divi-divi bird landed on the boom for a moment and then fluttered away . <p> " I think I have a place , " Blessington said , " if you still insist . A reef . " <p> " A reef , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meters offshore . " <p> " We could have a swim , non ? " <p> " We could , yes . " <p> " But I do n't know if I want to swim with you , Liam . I think you try to push me overboard . " <p> " I think I saved your life , " Blessington said . <p> They motored on to the reef with Freycinet standing in the bow to check for bottom as Blessington watched the depth recorder . At ten meters of bottom , they were an arm 's length from the single float in view . Blessington cut the engine and came about and then went forward to cleat a line to the float . The float was painted red , yellow , and green , Rasta colors like Gillian 's bracelet . <p> It was late afternoon and suddenly dead calm . The protection the Pitons offered from the wind was ideal and the bad current that ran over the reef to the south seemed to divide around these coral heads . A perfect dive site , Blessington though and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not more floats or more boats anchored there . It seemed a steady-enough place even for an overnight anchorage although the cruising guide advised against it because of the dangerous reefs on every side . <p> The big ketch lay motionless on unruffled water ; the float line dried slack . There was sandy beach and a palm-lined shore across the water . It was a lonely part of the coast , across a jungle mountain track from the island 's most remote resort . Through binoculars Blessington could make out a couple of boats hauled up on the strand but no one seemed ready to come out and hustle them . With luck it was too far from shore . <p> It might be also , he thought , that for metaphysical reasons they presented a forbidding aspect . But an aspect that deterred small predators might in time attract big ones . <p> Marie came up , pale and hollow-eyed , in her bikini . She gave Blessington a chastising look and lay down on the cushions on the afterdeck . Gillian came up behind her and took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fucker 's got no class , " she said softly . " See him hit me ? " <p> " Of course . I was next to you . " <p> " Gon na let him get away with that ? " <p> " Well , " Blessington said , " for the moment it behooves us to let him feel in charge . " <p> " Behooves us ? " she asked . " You say it behooves us ? " <p> " That 's right . " <p> " Hey , what were you gon na do back there , Liam ? ? she asked . " Deep-six him ? " <p> " I honestly do n't know . He might have fallen . " <p> " I was wondering , " she said . " He was wondering , too . " Blessington shrugged . <p> " He 's got the overstanding , " Gillian said . " We got the under . " She looked out at the water and said , " Boat boys . " <p> He looked where she was looking and saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It took a long time for it to cover the distance between the beach and the Sans Regret . <p> There were two boat boys and they were not boys but men in their thirties , lean and unsmiling . One wore a wool tam-o ' -shanter. in bright tie-dyed colors . The second looked like an East Indian . His black headband gave him a lascar look . <p> " You got to pay for dat anchorage , mon , " the man in the tam called to them . " Not open to de public widout charge . " <p> " We coming aboard , " said the lascar . " We take your papers and passports in for you . You got to clear . " <p> " How much for the use of the float ? " Blessington asked . <p> Suddenly Freycinet appeared in the companionway . He was carrying a big Remington 12-gauge , pointing it at the men in the boat , showing his pink-edged teeth . <p> You get the fuck out of here , " he shouted at them . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the cabin . " Understand ? " <p> The two men did not seem unduly surprised at Freycinet 's behavior . Blessington wondered if they could smell the dope as clistinctly as he could . <p> " Fuckin ' Frenchman , " the man in the tam said . " Think he some shit . " <p> " Why don ' you put the piece down , Frenchy ? " the East Indian asked . " This ai n't no Frenchy island . You got to clear . " <p> " You drift on that reef , Frenchy , " the man in the tam said . " You be begging us to take you off . " <p> Freycinet was beside himself with rage . He hated les negres more than any Frenchman Blessington had met in Martinique , which was saying a great deal . He had contained himself during the negotiations on Canouan but now he seemed out of control . Blessington began to wonder if he would shoot the pair of them . <p> " You fucking monkeys " he shouted . " You stay away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... mon , " he added with a sneer . <p> The men steered their boat carefully over the reef and sat with their outboard idling . They could not stay too long , Blessington thought , their gas tank as small and it was a long way out against a current . <p> " Well " he asked Gillian , " who 's got the overstanding now ? " <p> " Not Honore , " she said . <p> A haze of heat and doped lassitude settled over their mooring . Movement was labored , even speech seemed difficult . Blessington and Gillian nodded off on the gear locker . Marie seemed to have lured Freycinet belowdecks . Prior to dozing , Blessington heard her imitate the Frenchman 's angry voice and the two of them laughing down in the cabin . The next thing he saw clearly was Marie , in her bikini , standing on the cabin roof , screaming . A shotgun blasted and echoed over the still water . Suddenly the slack breeze had a brisk cordite smell and it carried smoke . <p> Freycinet shouted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two islanders in it seemed to have managed to come up on them . Now it raced off headed first out to sea to round the tip of the reef and then curving shoreward to take the inshore current at an angle . <p> " Everyone all right ? " asked Blessington . <p> " Fucking monkeys " swore . <p> " Well , " Blessington said , watching the boat disappear , " they 're gone for now . Maybe , " he suggested to Freycinet , " we can have our swim and go , too . " <p> Freycinet looked at him blankly as though he had no idea what Blessington was on about . He nodded vaguely . <p> After half an hour Marie rose and stood on the bulwark and prepared to dive , arms foremost . When she went , her dive was a good one , straight-backed and nearly splash-free . She performed a single stroke underwater and sped like a bright shaft between the coral heads below and the crystal surface . Then she appeared prettily in the light of day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> From his place in the bow , Freycinet watched Marie 's dive , her underwater career , her pert surfacing . His expression was not affectionate but taut and tight-lipped . The muscles in his neck stood out , his moves were twitchy like a street junkie 's . He looked exhausted and angry . The smell of cordite hovered around him . <p> " He 's a shithead and a loser , " Gillian said softly to Blessington . She looked not at Freycinet but toward the green mountains . " I thought he was cool . He was so fucking mean , I , like , respected that . Now we 're all gon na die . Well , " she said , " goes to show , right ? " <p> " Do n't worry , " Blessington told her . " I wo n't leave you . " <p> " Whoa , " said Gillian . " All right " But her enthusiasm was not genuine . She was mocking him . <p> Blessington forgave her . <p> Freycinet pointed a finger at Gillian . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na ? " she asked , already standing up . When he began to swear at her in a hoarse voice she took her clothes off in front of them . Everything but the Rasta bracelet . <p> " I think I will if no one minds , " she said . " Where you want me to swim to , Honore ? " <p> " Swim to fucking Amerique , " he said . He laughed as though his mood had improved . " You want her , Liam ? " <p> " People are always asking me that , " Blessington said . " What do I have to do ? " <p> " You swim to fucking Amerique with her . " <p> Blessington saw Gillian take a couple of pills from her cutoff pocket and swallow them dry . <p> " I ca n't swim that far , " Blessington said . <p> " Go as far as you can , " said Freycinet . <p> " How about you ? " Gillian said to the Frenchman . " You 're the one wanted to stop . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't trust her , " Freycinet said to Blessington . " What do you think ? " <p> " She 's a beauty , " Blessington said . " Do n't provoke her . " <p> Gillian measured her beauty against the blue water and dived over the side . A belly full of pills , Blessington thought . But her strokes when she surfaced were strong and defined . She did everything well , he thought . She was good around the boat . She had a pleasant voice for country music . He could imagine her riding , a cowgirl . <p> " Bimbo , eh ? " Freycinet asked . " That 's it , eh ? " <p> " Yes , " Blessington said . " Texas and all that . " <p> " Oui , " said Freycinet . " Texas . " He yawned . " Bien . Have your swim with her . If you want . " <p> Blessington went down into the stinking cabin and put his bathing suit on . Propriety to the last . The mixture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was asphyxiating . If he survived , he thought , he would never smoke hash again . Never drink rum , never do speed or cocaine , never sail or go where there were palm trees and too many stars overhead . A few fog-shrouded winter constellations would do . <p> " Tonight I 'll cook , eh ? " Freycinet said when Blessington came back up . " You can assist me . " <p> " Good plan , " said Blessington . <p> Standing on the bulwark , he looked around the boat . There were no other vessels in sight . Marie was swimming backstroke , describing a safe circle about twenty-five yards out from the boat . Gillian appeared to be headed hard for the open sea . She had reached the edge of the current , where the wind raised small horsetails from the rushing water . <p> If Freycinet was planning to leave them in the water , Blessington wondered , would he leave Marie with them ? It would all be a bad idea because Freycinet was not a a skilled sailor . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here or even of their making it to shore , although that seemed most unlikely . On the other hand he had discovered that Freycinet 's ideas were often impulses , mainly bad ones . It was his recklessness that had made him appear so capably in charge and that was as true in the kitchen as it was on the Raging Main . We had been a reckless cook . <p> Besides , there were a thousand dark possibilities on that awful ocean . That he had arranged to be met at sea off Martinique , that there had been some betrayal in the works throughout . Possibly involving Lavigerie or someone else in Fort-de-France . <p> " Yes , " said Blessington . " There 's time to unfreeze the grouper . " <p> He looked at the miles of ocean between the boat and the beach at the foot of the mountains : Far off to the right he could see white water , the current running swiftly over the top of a reef that extended southwesterly , at a 45 degree angle to the beach . Beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its narrow southern end . On their left , the base of the mountains extended to the edge of the sea , forming a rock wall against which the waves broke . According to the charts , the wall plunged to a depth of ten fathoms , and the ocean concealed a network of submarine caves and grottoes in the volcanic rock of which the Pitons were composed . Across the towering ridge , completely out of sight , was a celebrated resort . <p> " I 'll take it out of the freezer , " Blessington said . <p> A swimmer would have to contrive to make land somewhere between the rock wall to the north and the reef and sandspit on the right . There would be easy swimming at first , through the windless afternoon , and a swimmer would not feel any current for the first mile or so . The last part of the swim would be partly against a brisk current , and possibly against the tide . The final mile would seem much farther . For the moment , wind was not in evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one drew closer to shore . If only one could swim across it in time . <p> " It 's all right , " said Freycinet . " I 'll do it . Have your swim . " <p> Beyond that , there was the possibility of big sharks so far out . They might be attracted by the effort of desperation . Blessington , exhausted and dehydrated , was in no mood for swimming miles . Freycinet would not leave them there , off the Pitons , he told himself . It was practically in sight of land . He would be risking too much , witnesses , their survival . If he meant to deep-six them he would try to strike at sea . <p> Stoned and frightened as he was , he could not make sense of it , regain his perspective . He took a swig from a plastic bottle of warm Evian water , dropped his towel , and jumped overboard . The water felt good , slightly cool . He could relax against it and slow the beating of his heart . It seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home in the water , he thought . Marie was frolicking like a mermaid , now close to the boat . Gillian had turned back and was swimming toward him . Her stroke still looked strong and accomplished ; he set out to intercept her course . <p> They met over a field of elkhorn coral . Some of the formations were so close to surface that their feet , treading water , brushed the velvety skin of algae over the sharp prongs . <p> " How are you Blessington asked her . <p> She had a lupine smile . She was laughing , looking at the boat . Her eyes appeared unfocused , the black pupils huge under the blue glare of afternoon and its shimmering , crystal reflection . She breathed in hungry swallows . Her face was raw and swollen where Freycinet had hit her . <p> " Look at asshole , " she said , gasping . <p> Freycinet was standing on deck talking to Marie , who was in the water ten feet away . He held a mask and snorkel in one hand and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one he threw the toys into the water for Marie to retrieve . He looked coy and playful . <p> Something about the scene troubled Blessington although he could not , in his state , quite reason wt it was . He watched Freycinet take a few steps back and paw the deck like an angry bull . In the next moment , Blessington realized what the problem was . <p> " Oh , Jesus Christ , " he said . <p> Freycinet leaped into space . He still wore the greasy shorts he had worn on the whole trip . In midair he locked his arms around his bent knees . He was holding a plastic spatula in his right hand . He hit the surface like a cannonball , raising a little waterspout , lose enough to Marie to make her yelp . <p> " You know what ? " Gillian asked . She had spotted it . She was amazing . <p> " Yes , I do . The ladder 's still up . We forgot to lower it . " <p> " Shit , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his back and tried to calm himself . Overhead the sky was utterly cloudless . Moving his eyes only a little he could see the great green tower of Gros Piton , shining like Jacob 's ladder itself , thrusting toward the empty blue . Incredibly far above , a plane drew out its jet trail , a barely visible needle stitching the tiniest flaw in the vast perfect seamless-curtain of day . Miles and miles above , beyond imagining . <p> " How we gon na get aboard ? " Gillian asked . He did not care for the way she was acting in the water now , struggling to stay afloat , moving her arms too much , wasting her breath . <p> " We 'll have to go up the float line . Or maybe , " he said , " we can stand on each other 's shoulders . " <p> " I 'm not , " she said , gasping , " gon na like that too well . " <p> " Take it easy , Gillian . Lie on your back . " <p> What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with each breath . <p> " Okay , let 's do it , " she said , spitting salt water . " Let 's do it before he does . " <p> " Slow and steady , " Blessington said . <p> They slowly swam together , breaststroke toward the boat . A late-afternoon breeze had come up as the temperature began to fall . <p> Freycinet and Marie had allowed themselves to drift farther and farther from the boat . Blessington urged Gillian along beside him until the big white hull was between them and the other swimmers . <p> Climbing was impossible . It was partly the nature of the French-made boat ; an unusually high transom and the rounded glassy hull made it particularly difficult to board except from a dock or a dinghy . That was the contemporary , security-conscious style . And the rental company had removed a few of the deck fittings that might have provided hand- and footholds . Still , he tried to find a grip so that Gillian could get on his shoulders . Once he even managed to get between her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hull , sitting on his neck . But there was no place to grab and she was stoned . She swore and laughed and toppled off his shoulders . <p> He was swimming forward along the hull , looking for the float , when it occurred to him suddenly that the boat must be moving . Sure enough , holding his place , he could feel the hull sliding to windward under his hand . In a few strokes he was under the bow , feeling the ketch 's weight thrusting forward , riding him down . Then he saw the Rastafarian float . The float was unoccupied , unencumbered by any line . Honore and Marie had not drifted from the boat -- the boat itself was slowly blowing away , accompanied now by the screech of fiberglass against coral , utterly unsecured . The boys from the Pitons , having dealt with druggies before , had undone the mooring line while they were sleeping or nodding off or scarfing other sorts of lines . <p> Blessington hurried around the hull , with one hand to the boat 's skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might , he thought , be possible to struggle up along that . But there was no drifting float line . The boat boys must have uncleated it and balled the cleat in nylon line and silently tossed it aboard . They had been so feckless , the sea so glassy , and the wind so low that the big boat had simply settled on the float , with its keel fast among the submerged elkhorn , and they had imagined themselves secured . The Sans Regret . to which he clung , was gone . Its teak interiors were in another world now , as far away as the tiny jet miles above them on its way to Brazil . <p> " It 's no good , " Blessington said to her . <p> " It 's not ? " She giggled . <p> " Please , " he said , " please do n't do that . " <p> She gasped . " What ? " <p> " Never mind , " he said . " Come with me . " <p> They had just started to swim away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two couples , leaving Blessington and Gillian and Honore and Marie to face one another in the water across a distance of twenty yards or so . Honor and Marie stared at their shipmates in confusion . It was an embarrassing moment . Gillian laughed . <p> " What have you done ? " Honor asked Blessington . Blessington tried not to look at him . <p> " Come on , " he said to Gillian . " Follow me . " <p> Cursing in French , Freycinet started kicking furiously for the boat . Marie , looking very serious , struck out behind him . Gillian stopped to look after them . Blessington glanced at his diver 's watch . It was 5:15 . <p> " Never mind them , " he said . " Do n't look at them . Stay with me . " <p> He turned over on his back and commenced an artless backstroke , arms out straight , rowing with his palms , paddling with his feet . It was the most economic stroke he knew , the one he felt most comfortable with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than random and splashy to avoid conveying any impression of panic or desperation . To free his mind , he tried counting the strokes . As soon as they were over deep water , he felt the current . He tried to take it at a 45 degree angle , determining his bearing and progress by the great mountain overhead . <p> " Are you all right ? " he asked Gillian . He raised his head to have a look at her . She was swimming in what looked like a good strong crawl . She coughed from time to time . <p> " I 'm cold , " she said . " That 's the trouble . " <p> " Try resting on your back , " he said " and paddling with your open hands . Like you were rowing . " <p> She turned over and closed her eyes and smiled . <p> " I could go to sleep . " <p> " You 'll sleep ashore , " he said . " Keep paddling . " <p> They heard Freycinet cursing . Marie began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . <p> Checking on the mountain , Blessington felt a rush of despair . The lower slopes of the jungle were turning dark green . The line dividing sun-bright vegetation from deep-shaded green was withdrawing toward the peak . And it looked no closer . He felt as though they were losing distance , being carried out faster than they could paddle . Marie 's relentless screeches went on and on . Perhaps they were actually growing closer , Blessington thought , perhaps an evening tide was carrying them out . <p> " Poor kid , " Gillian said . " Poor little baby . " <p> " Do n't listen , " he said . <p> Gillian kept coughing , sputtering . He stopped asking her if she was all right . <p> " I 'm sorry , " she said . " I 'm really cold now . I thought the water was warm at first . " <p> " We 're almost there , " he said . <p> Gillian stopped swimming and looked up at Gros Piton . Turning over again to swim , she got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . <p> " Keep going , Gillian . " <p> It seemed to him as he rowed the sodden vessel of his body and mind that the sky was darkening . The sun 's mark withdrew higher on the slopes . Marie kept screaming . They heard splashes far off where the boat was now . Marie and Honore were clinging to it . <p> " Liam , " Gillian said , " you ca n't save me . " <p> " You 'll save yourself , " he said . " You 'll just go on . " <p> " I ca n't . " <p> " Do n't be a bloody stupid bitch . " <p> " I do n't think so , " she said . " I really do n't . " <p> He stopped rowing himself then although he was loath to . Every interruption of their forward motion put them more at the mercy of the current . According to the cruise book it was only a five-knot current but it felt much stronger . Probably reinforced by a ride . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held her head up , greedy for air , her mouth open like a baby bird 's in hope of nourishment . Blessington swam nearer her . The sense of their time ticking away , of distance lost to the current , enraged him . <p> " You 've got to turn over on your back , " he said gently . " Just ease onto your back and rest there . Then arch your back . Let your head lie backward so your forehead 's in the water . " <p> Trying to do as he told her , she began to thrash in a tangle of her own arms and legs . She swallowed water , gasped . Then she laughed again . <p> " Do n't , " he whispered . <p> " Liam ? Can I rest on you ? " <p> He stopped swimming toward her . <p> " You must n't . You mus n't touch me . We must n't touch each other . We might ... " <p> " Please , " she said . <p> " No . Get on your back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water near them . He thought it was the fin of a black-tipped shark . A troublesome shark but not among the most dangerous . Of course , it could have been anything . Gillian still had the Rasta bracelet around her wrist . <p> " This is the thing , Liam . I think I got a cramp . I 'm so dizzy . " <p> " On your back , love . You must . It 's the only way . " <p> " No , " she said . " I 'm too cold . I 'm too dizzy . " <p> " Come on , " he said . He started swimming again . Away from her . <p> " I 'm so dizzy . I could go right out . " <p> In mounting panic , he reversed direction and swam back toward her . <p> " Oh , shit , " she said . " Liam ? " <p> " I 'm here . " <p> " I 'm fading out , Liam . I 'll let it take me . " <p> " Get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You can easily swim . If you have to swim all night . " <p> " Oh , shit , " she said . Then she began to laugh again . She raised the hand that had the Rasta bracelet and splashed a sign of the cross . <p> " Nam , " she said , " nam myoho renge kyo . Son of a bitch . " Laughing . What she tried to say next was washed out of her mouth by a wave . <p> " I can just go out , " she said . " I 'm so dizzy . " <p> Then she began to struggle and laugh and cry . <p> " Praise God , from whom all blessings flow , " she sang , laughing . " Praise Him , all creatures here below . " <p> " Gillian , ' he said . " For God 's sake . " Maybe I can take her in , he thought . But that was madness and he kept his distance . <p> She was laughing and shouting at the top of her voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Praise Father , Son , and Holy Ghost . " <p> Laughing , thrashing , she went under , her face straining . wide-eyed . Blessington tried to look away but it was too late . He was afraid to go after her . <p> He lost his own balance then . His physical discipline collapsed and he began to wallow and thrash as she had . <p> " Help " he yelled piteously . He was answered by a splash and Marie 's screaming . Perhaps now he only imagined them . <p> Eventually he got himself under control . When the entire mountain had subsided into dark green , he felt the pull of the current release him . The breakers were beginning to carry him closer to the sand , toward the last spit of sandy beach remaining on the island . The entire northern horizon was subsumed in the mountain overhead , Gros Piton . <p> He had one final mad moment . Fifty yards offshore , a riptide was running , it seized him and carried him behind the tip of the island . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . The sun was setting as he waded out , among sea grape and manchineel . When he turned he could see against the setting sun the bare poles of the Sans Regret , settled on the larger reef to the south of the island . It seemed to him also that he could make out a struggling human figure , dark against the light hull . But the dark came down quickly . He thought he detected a flash of green . Sometimes he thought he could still hear Marie screaming . <p> All night , as he rattled through the thick brush looking for a road to follow from concealment , Gillian 's last hymn echoed in his mind 's ear . He could see her dying face against the black fields of sugarcane through which he trudged . <p> Once he heard what he was certain was the trumpeting of an elephant . It made him believe , in his growing delirium , that he was in Africa -- Africa , where he had never been . He hummed the hymn . Then he remembered he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bush . But he did not want to meet it so he decided to stay where he was and wait for morning . All night he talked to Gillian , joked and sang hymns with her . He saved her again and again and they were together . <p> In the morning , when the sun rose fresh and full of promise , he set out for the Irish bar in Soufrere . He thought that they might overstand him there . <p> 
##1003709 In his newest collection of essays and allegorical tales , Derrick Bell once again employs his unique blend of fiction and reality to explore the myriad issues of race and politics in our society In the following parable , Bell 's character Jesse Semple ( inspired by the Langston Hughes hero , Jesse B. Semple ) weaves the amazing story of a protest mounted by Black women in response to a Freedom of Employment Act before Congress . This fictitious bill proposes to remedy the nation 's " growing racial hostility " by eliminating affirmative-action programs and initiating even more drastic measures to redress " the racial injustices suffered by Whites disadvantaged by civil rights laws and policies . " True to our history , Black women have an extraordinary and powerful response . When I think about Jesus and what He 's done for me When I think about Jesus and how He set me free I can dance dance dance dance dance dance all night . <p> -Andrae Crouch <p> This , probably the most spectacular racial demonstration in the history of civil rights , captured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was virtually no other news coverage , not even sports or the weather . But the best account is the one Jesse Semple gave his brother , who had been on vacation in one of the few remaining places in the world that manage to get along without newspapers or television . CONTINU ED ON PAGE sz ) <p> Man , it was something ! I can not believe you missed it-and no way , no way in this world can I describe it to you . But , listen , because you are and have been my main man going all the way back , as well as my brother , I 'm going to try to do the impossible . I 'm goin ' to paint a picture for you . <p> Okay , okay , it was a beautiful morning , late spring . In fact , it was the mornin of the day when Congress was all set to take a tinal vote on the Freedom of Employment Act . You know , the one to end affirmative action and , some people say , start Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , early that mornin ' , Black women of every description under Heaven began gathering ' longside major thoroughfares and in front of government buildings . Women turned out early in major cities across the country . <p> Now get this . These women were young , old and all manner of in-between . They were all the sizes , shapes , colors you can imagine-even if you let your imagination get carried away . This was n't no class thing . To tell you the truth , it was n't a strictly Black thing , either . I saw some White women , Asian and Hispanic women . But mostly the women were Black . It was somethin ' . There were women who do day work , secretaries , factory workers , housewives , teachers , beauticians , businesswomen , doctors and lawyers and anything else you can think of . Yep . There were some street hustlers there and some nuns in their habits . Some seditty society ladies and some who , if they did n't split verbs , could n't use no verbs at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seemin'ly so spread out that nobody paid them no never-mind . If anyone noticed as more and more of ' em gathered , they did n't say nothin ' . Police ? Police did n't come until later , and by then , nothin ' they could do ' ceptin ' look foolish and act vicious , which of course some of them proceeded to do . But , I tell you , these Black women were so natural , so dry-long-so lookin ' that no one was upset or nervous , as often happens when they 's more Black people someplace than there is White people . <p> Those women near post offices formed orderly lines as though waitin ' for the doors to open to buy stamps . Women gathered at bus stops look like they waitin ' to go to work . Many of the sisters seemed to be walkin ' toward markets , malls or department stores with nothing more serious ' n shoppin ' on their minds . <p> I mean , none of them seemed hassled or in a hurry . Their numbers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ESSENCE JULY 1 9 9 6 dreds of thousands-at the very least . They gossiped with one another , laughed , kidded and exchanged greetings across plazas , up on overpasses , down flights of steps . I mean-do n't get me wrong-you could tell these were Black women even if you was blind and could only hear ' em . No , man , not loud-just Black . <p> Then at ten o'clock , precisely on the hour , all of these Black women across the country began-now get this ! hearin in their heads a large band playing music for dancin ' . And not just any dancin ' . Every one of these women knew the music immediately As one , they yelled in friendly recognition of the sounds they all loved : the electric slide ! <p> They screamed , cheered and clapped their hands , hearin ' that band playin ' Marcia Griffiths 's dance lyrics with plenty of melody and even more rhythm . Then in one gigantic movement from coast to coast , the women moved en masse into the center of the avenues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , subway platforms , train stations and airport-passenger terminals . As they moved , they already doin ' the electric slide , doin ' it as only Black women can . <p> What a sight ! Man , what can I say ? It was poetry in motion , but that 's too trite . It was rhythmic readiness , but that 's too suggestive . What you say ? Oh , militant movement . Yep , maybe . That sounds better , but man , there was a joy in the dancing , too . It was a soulful response to the music , all those women actin ' together but also for their ownselves . In fact , what they were doing puts the word movement to shame . <p> Now , you know , you do n't need a partner to do the electric slide . Men and women , old and young , form lines , not formal , just what comes naturally . And , with no partner , you get in rhythm with the other people in your line . Or if the spirit moves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the side , or if the spirit really moves you , you do whatever feels good . <p> Do n't get me wrong . This ai n't no sexist or sex-motivated thing , but I just love to watch our women move while they doin ' the electric slide . Seeing them do that dance is like-well , it 's like Liberation Time . Somehow , dancing in those lines with everybody doing the basic steps , goiri backward and forward and turnin ' at the same time , well , man , that gives ' em somethin ' to work with . They sense a freedom to be free-to improvise like their bodies are musical instruments . And what I 'm sayin ' , this is true of fly chicks from out on the avenue and dignified professional women , including judges , doctors CONTINUED ON PAGE 124 and legislators . They all get down , as we both know . Their expressions are too much . " Hey ! " they 're sayin ' without utterin ' a word . " Hey , world , this is me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I may never be again . This is about celebratin ' me . Dig it ? Me ! " Okay , so you get the picture . Well , imagine that dance floor with the electric slide goin ' by , spread out all over America on major avenues and intersections . As those women all begin to move , traffic and everythin ' else comes to a stop . For a time , the White folks was mesmerized . Even most of them willin ' to give us our due when it comes to dancin ' . But then folks noticed that nothin ' runnin ' , that everythin ' backed up . The women do n't seem to notice the growing commotion . The horns honkin ' , the shouts and curses . By now , they 're into the electric slide as never before . And how does the gospel song go ? " They ai n't noways tired . " Even the police get ignored , which no police like . Especially when the ignorin ' is by Black folk . Especially by Black women . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the women keeps on dancin ' . <p> By this time , there 's many more Black women joinin ' in , fillin ' all the public places both in the cities where the thing started and now in hundreds of other places . And they ai n't even thinkin ' about stoppin ' . They just steady dancin ' they behinds off . <p> Police reinforcements , including the riot squads , come out . First , they kinda taken aback . Then they start in yellin ' threats over their bullhorns and tryin ' to clear the streets and intersections . The women get shoved this way and that , but they keep on dancin ' . They do n't even seem to see the police . So if you can believe it-and I know you can-the police start using their billy clubs . Yeah , man ! On the Black women . But the women do n't panic . They try to shield themselves by puttin ' their arms up and around their heads and dancin ' in tight groups , but they keep on dancin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the women , electric-slide music shifted to a big choir singin ' " I 'm so glad trouble do n't last always . " And the sisters start singin ' along as they are dancin ' . Now , we ca n't hear the gospel choir , but the sisters is they own gospel choir , . the movin ' , swayin ' voices of thousands of women , all singin ' ' bout how God may not come when you call Him , but He 's right on time . Well , man , it had to be the biggest , baddest gospel choir in all of history ! Something , man ! Something ! <p> Meanwhile , the police flailin ' away , notwithstandin ' all of this gorgeous sound and harmony which gives the women strength to face anythin ' . When one of the sisters is hurt and falls , three or four other women stops and carries her over to the side , where Black men and women , doctors and nurses come out of nowhere and tend to the wounded . They carry out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got on the scene . <p> The Black men ? Well , a lot of men , some caring for young children , are standing on the sidelines . And this is men from all walks of life-I mean all walks of life . They helps carry out the women who are hit , and they helps keep the children calm . But ' cept for a few brothers who lost it and had to be held back from wadin ' in after the police , the men do not interfere with the women , even though some must be their sisters , wives , mothers , girlfriends . <p> It was powerful , man ! Brings tears to my eyes just tellin ' you about it . This protest was a Black women 's thing just like the electric slide 's a Black women 's dance . The men knew it , respected it , supported it . But they did n't jump in , try to take over , or tell their women to leave . I 've never seen nothin ' like it . Brother , give me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choked up to talk . I ai n't never in my life been so proud to be Black . We ai n't got much and gettin ' less and less all the time . But we got heart and we got soul . Sometime I think we the only ones got it . <p> And what do we get ? We get no R-E-S-P-E-C-T , as Aretha d put it . They try to beat it out of us . And mostly , they use the police to do it . The police ? Where I was watchin ' , they gave up and stood by-in case the women should try to enter buildings and such , which they never did give any intention of doin . The TV news reported that in other cities the police got carried away and fired tear gas into the dancers . Some women were overcome , but most just moved down the avenues , still dancin ' , until the police give up . <p> Even when there was a hullabaloo , the women did not even slow the tempo . They danced all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them sandwiches and drinks . And some of the older women would take breaks . But nobody left until it was over at 10 P.M. on the East Coast . <p> Meanwhile , back at the Congress , that mornin ' all they could see out their windows was thousand of Black women dancin ' all around the Capitol building . What ? Sure , they got nervous . Would n't you ? They put off the vote . Claimed it was ' cause the dancin ' kept a bunch of the congresspeople from getting to work . Savin ' face is what they was doin ' , if you ask me . <p> Bring the bill up for a vote tomorrow or next week ? That 's what they 're claimin ' . Me , I do n't believe it . White folks is stupid on race stuff , but they ai n't crazy . They know Black folks all fired up . Same everywhere , far as I can make out . TV not sayin ' very much , but I have not seen so much plannin ' and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups say they want to do something just as big , and even the national civil-rights groups claim they 'll be leading protests and boycotts . <p> I think people serious this time . It 's like back in 1960 , after those four college students protested segregation by sitting in at that lunch counter back in Greensboro , North Carolina . They started somethin ' that spread across the South , across the country . And they was only four , not 4 million . I think this electric-slide protest has started something . Something big . What ? No , bro ' , I have not heard a word about the Freedom of Employment Act . In fact , I 'll bet you real money that we do n't hear about that bill again . 0 <p> Author Affiliation 
##1003710 When not frightened , they slowly crawl along with their tails and bellies dragging on the ground . They often stop , and doze for a minute or two , with closed eyes and hind legs spread out on the parched soil . -Charles Darwin -- Charles Darwin The three of them have been quiet for the last hour . Tired . Their bodies tired . Their conversation tired . That happens with the seventh drink . Something about the seventh drink . It 's like the onslaught of middle age , depressing , disheartening , you ca n't believe you 've arrived at this particular spot . But you slog through . An eighth drink . A ninth drink . And boom ! at the ten-drink mark you change and you accept this life you 've made for yourself , a perfectly fine life , a solid life , and in the end a life you ca n't do anything about . But these guys , at present , are stuck in the midlife crisis of the seventh drink . Zev has almost completely given up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bubble from his drooling mouth , similar to a Saint Bernard in the midst of a nightmare . But he 's always doing that , slumping wherever he can , on park benches , against walls . A passerby might think he 's just heard awful news . <p> McGraw is next to him , busy trying not to see his own reflection in the bottle-lined mirror behind the bar . To be a vampire would be cool , he imagines , an invisible presence , with only your consequences being felt . He reaches for a pack of cigarettes , his finger extending the same way God or Adam-he ca n't remember which-extends his finger on the Sistine ceiling . Nearby , Chester leans forward and smiles his smile at the bartender . It is a well-designed smile , practiced in front of the mirror and over the years cultivated into an open-mouthed smile , not too toothy , not crooked . All in all it 's a smile of good faith that says , Nothing up my gums , no secrets in my cheeks . And the tongue is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the wallet . " Bueno country here , muy bueno , mi amigo , " he says as if he really speaks the language . By now he has his wallet out , that thick piece of leather so impressive to the Third World , and he 's handing over a laminated I.D . to the bartender . This is the part of the job that Chester loves , saying the following words the same way James Bond says his name . " Press . " He pauses . " CNN News . " " Press ? " " Si . We 're here to do a little story . " After decades in the business , Chester never specifies the details of anything . That way everyone is on guard , everyone is helpful , and everyone bends over backwards because everyone , from coat-check girl to President of the United States , thinks the story is about the twisted world they inhabit . It can also sometimes get him a free drink . " For the First Lady ? " the bartender asks . Chester reluctantly confirms the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to be secretive , this is n't a scoop . The First Lady of the United States is coming here . A short stay . A little reprieve from Washington . She 's always wanted to visit the Galapagos Islands-her statement to the press-a place of origins , a place of beauty , a place of scientific discovery , a place like no other place in the world . Unique . So Chester and crew have been sent over to cover her brief journey . For them , it 's a working vacation . A deserved break . Just soft news wrapped up in a twenty-second kicker at the end of a newscast . There 's no reason for a reporter to be dragged along . Besides , their man Laraby is dead anyway . Chester checks on the state of his colleagues and figures that " We need another drink , a muy macho one . " The bartender smiles . " How about a Guy Fawkes ? " " Que 's that ? " " A bomb that 'll blow you away . " " Sounds bueno . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement , the bartender sets out three glasses , each one shaped like a gunpowder keg . He packs in crushed ice , then pours in the contents of various bottles : rum , vodka , triple sec , tequila , orange and cranberry juice . When all mixed up and ready to go , the straw stands as straight as a fuse . " This is the Emergency Broadcasting System , " Chester calls out to the other two , his voice a monotone bugle . " This is not a test . The end is near . The bombs are falling . You know , just once I 'd like to hear that . " McGraw slaps Zev a few timesit 's the only way to wake him up . Zev stirs with the speed of an ugly flower blooming . Seeing the drink in front of him-What a funny glass ! he picks it up and deep-throats half of the brown liquid . " Kaboom , " he whispers . It does n't take much to envision this huge man as a mythical titan with a hogshead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a face as big as a spare tire . He toasts , " Pozovite kola za hitnu pomoc , " to the three of them , having forgotten any sense of procedure . " What the hell 's that mean ? " " Call a fucking ambulance , " is the Serbo-Croatian translation . Zev loves to inhabit his English with a herd of free-roaming expletives . A fresh load of tourists enters the airport bar . Many are American , but many are German and many are Australian and quite a few are Dutch . They take the tables , dumping cameras and sunblock on the highly polished surfaces , removing Panama hats , sunbonnets , pith helmets , baseball caps that have molded a slight tonsure into their bleached blond , permed , mop-topped , feathercut hair . Everyone here is ready to be St. Francis . Or Dr. Dolittle . They all let out deep sighs , almost in unison , as if a forced march has been completed , the ball and chain of carryon luggage resting at their feet . McGraw lights up another cigarette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The tobacco clouds seem , for a second , to sublimate his flesh from a painfully obvious solid-stubby limbs , bad skin , dandruff-into a mysterious vapor . He inhales and pauses , licking his lips , then blows out a casual blast , imagining within the whirlwind whole trailer parks sucked up and spinning . He stares at the lava red of the cigarette ; the barely burning paper is lovely . The smoke unfurls from the glowing ash the same way gossamer shoots from a spider 's anus . That 's an attribute Spiderman was lucky to avoid . Everyone would be disgusted , no matter how many times you saved Manhattan from the evil Dr. Octopus . The theme song to the afternoon cartoon-Spiderman , Spiderman , does whatever a spider can-begins to loop in his head . Growing up , McGraw lived for comic books , his room cluttered with stacks of colored newsprint . But he was n't crazy about the superheroes or supervillains . They were boring , all identical except for their particular gimmicks . No , he loved the secret identities , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dr. Bruce Banner-normal joes with that hidden power to influence a planet . Anytime . Anywhere . And even though somewhere in the world a tragedy happened every second of every day , sometimes Clark Kent let it slide and did n't listen with super-hearing and did n't look with super-vision . Nope . Instead , he went to work , earned a measly living as a reporter , and turned in puff pieces while children screamed in bright burning fires . " Some chasers , " Chester is suggesting . " The second wave of the attack is on . Commander Zev , you order the counterstrike . " " Sta ? " " Get us some beer . " " Ja bih tri pivo , molim . " " Speak Spanish , you asshole . Do your job for a change . " After fumbling through his Berlitz phrase book , Zev spits out , " Tomare tres cerveza , por favor . " The pronunciation is awful , like a ventriloquist trying to do a bit with water in his mouth . " Man , you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth . " McGraw changes his order to a Bloody Mary , and sitting there quietly , he begins to think to himself in a bad Transylvanian accent , rolling over the r 's , slamming shut the k 's . He has it all figured out . A superhero vampire-by day he processes film in a newspaper 's darkroom ; it 's always night in there and has the chemical smell of a casket leaking embalming fluid . And when the sun goes down he rights the wrongs on the frontpage photos . The murdered child . The oil spill . The gangster acquitted on a technicality . Murrow-that 'd be his name-would shuck his lab clothes for a black outfit , tastefully done , with a trench coat as cape . And the next morning , he 'd feign ignorance at the newly developed pictures , at the newly bannered headlines , at the do-good deeds of the night angel they call Murrow . Then again , maybe it 's too much like Batman . And what if all of those villains became part of the undead ? That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter the bar . Neither wears a uniform , except both have those large mustaches favored by terrorists and pilots alike . Stewardesses follow closely behind . Their conversation sounds flirty , but in Spanish everything sounds flirty . Zev asks the bartender about the Spanish word for cunt , pussy , twat , you know , pastrmku , you know , polu-peceno sunku , you know , vagina . " Cono , " the bartender mutters . " Cono . " Zev consults his phrase book . " Donde esta el cono mas cercano , por favor ? " He thumbs through a page . " Se puede ir andando ? " The bartender smiles . They all have a good laugh-Chester just pretending to understand-while a voice comes over the loudspeaker and speaks in five different languages . II They inhabit burrows .... One front leg for a short time scratches up the soil , and throws it towards the hind foot , which is well placed so as to heave it beyond the mouth of the hole . That side of the body being tired , the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -Charles Darwin But before this , before the Galapagos , about two weeks before , there is Sarajevo and there is the death of Richard Laraby , the reporter , the tall blond stud who used to play quarterback for Georgia Tech . He does n't die live . No , it 's taped . But they tape everything . Then they edit . Then they transmit the finished story back to Atlanta . That 's their day , a **27;183;TOOLONG report . A little blood , a little suffering , a little gunplay , then bring on the drinks and maybe tonight a little hash . But sometimes Laraby will do a live follow-up , a real pain , and at three in the morning he 'll stand in the alley behind the Hilton , freezing his nuts off , and he 'll answer softball questions about the spirit of the Sarajevan people . " There is a haunted look on their faces , " he 'll say to the headlights of the camera , the Southern tic trained out of his voice . " Their eyes well past desperation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city behind me , dark now , its scars hidden , only a semblance of humanity remains . " This , in fact , is an apt description of Laraby and Chester and McGraw , the three of them huddling in that alley , the only safe place to kick up the generator and the mercury lights . Tonight , the network wants the word " Live " tagged to the vanity corner of the screen . The falling snow will be an added bonus . A nice touch . And it will film beautifully , the flakes creating an optical effect of movement so that if you relaxed your eyes a bit Laraby seems to slowly lift into the air . It would n't take much . The man is losing weight , everybody can see that , and his clothes are starting to look absurdly ill-fitted . " They 're getting letters , " Chester tells him at dinner . They 're sitting in the main restaurant at the Hilton , every table filled with members of the world press . The Hilton , except for the gaping hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . A new Babel . Much better than the Winter Olympics . " Letters ? " " About your weight . I guess people are worried . They want you to eat . " Laraby lifts up a forkful of rice and beans . A pile of stringy meat , zebra flanks that Zev managed to hustle up from the condemned zoo , remains untouched along the edge . " Well , " he says , " next time bring on the monkey . Yum yum . " Chester reaches into his leather sidebag and pulls out a handful of mini chocolate bars , treats he gives to kids who pose in rubble . " Just put on some weight . " With surprising quickness McGraw snatches one of the candies , but the movement still feels wasted . Telekinesis would be so much purer , the mind 's tentacles grabbing on to the things you need while the useless body shrivels below the neck . McGraw has lost weight as well , about ten pounds in the last year . God knows where it comes from , he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even though this winter his skin is starting to turn a shade of light blue-not a good sign-and the camera 's feeling a bit heavy . " What time do we go ? " he asks , the chocolate doing somersaults in his mouth . " Three-thirteen A.M. We have the fourth spot . " Laraby nods . This is a great opportunity , this ongoing story , this constant coverage for the last year , and the public 's growing familiarity with his face . At least four times a week he files a report . There 's Laraby standing next to the destroyed cathedral , mosque , temple . There 's Laraby in front of the Olympic oval now used as a mass graveyard . " The Siege of Sarajevo " -the network 's bloody banner-belongs solely to Laraby , and he 's a hit . Number one with a bullet . Back home , mainly in the South , a fan club has started up ; they call themselves Larababes and they flood CNN with letters asking about this new reporter : Is he married ? No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years old . How tall ? Six foot one . What denomination ? Baptist . But about a month ago , the letters began to change : He looks pale ! Feed him ! He needs some color ! Bring him home , poor thing ! " I think you also need a haircut , " Chester adds . Laraby runs his hands through his greasy hair . This is certainly the longest it 's ever been , a good two inches below the ear , but he 's enjoying the look . " I do n't know . " " On camera you 're getting a bit mangy . " " You think ? " " Yeah . " " Okay . " " Good . " Chester usually gets his way . He 's the veteran producer , a legend in the field and a witness to over twenty years of conflict . Algeria to Zaire , a passport as thick as a phone book , that 's what he 'll tell you if you 're next to him at a party . What he wo n't tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't so funnylooking . Long neck . No chin . A pinhead a few degrees fatter than a sideshow freak . All he has is that smile , that great smile , and a voice that can talk anyone into anything . Just ask his three ex-wives . Outside it 's quiet , the shelling on temporary hiatus , but people still huddle over their food in case dust starts to fall . Most of the tables are in the process of a long drink , no live shot for them tonight , the story bagged and tagged , and Zev goes over to the French correspondents to get a hit of hash . Everyone smokes Turkish hash , sent over by the Muslim brethren . " Fucking puisje voir la carte ? " says Zev , slapping a few loose hands . McGraw watches Zev take a long puckered drag from a pipe , watches Zev look over at him and smile , the smoke slowly curling out of his turnip-sized nostrils . To the bat cave , McGraw says to himself , and he gives Zev the finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the alley ? " he asks Chester . " Yeah . Though I 'd love to get on the roof somehow , especially if there 's some good shelling . " Chester smiles . " That 'd be a great shot , Laraby on the fucking roof as the city explodes behind him . " Laraby , of course , agrees . He agrees to everything Chester suggests . At first it was a problem . A bit apprehensive , he wanted to keep his distance . Back in the states Laraby covered natural disasters , that was his gig , his first stint being Hurricane Hugo in " 89 . He impressed people with his compassion , and as he toured Charleston , chunks of roof in his path , trees snapped over in tragic supplication , he spoke to the camera and said , " What Sherman once spared , Hugo has damned . " Fucking poetry . And the woman showing him around , a blond coed at the College of Charleston , her name an old Southern name that rhymes with lots-of-dough , she fell in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love with her . Weeks later the San Francisco earthquake hit . Then the California fires . Hurricane Andrew . When the dust cleared from those crazy three years , Laraby , the new golden boy , had been married , cheated on , lied to , and divorcedJesus , you can be fooled ! -and he was now ready to visit the site of a public Armageddon . " We need something big , " Chester is saying . " People are getting bored with the same old stuff . " " Yeah ? " " It 's got to get sexier . " This is true . Same old stuff , that 's a huge danger . Fresh angles are important , fresh ways of telling this story . Maybe a profile on the upcoming production of Hair . Or how about something ironic on the Museum of the Revolution . You ca n't just have mortar shells and rubble and blood , mothers " breaking down over the day 's corpses . There has to be context , no matter how powerful the image . Hell , McGraw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the next . Postmortems floating down the Sava River . Hanged men and boys festooning trees . Women beating themselves to kill the product of rape . You ca n't believe what you see-it seems so unreal-and in the end you do n't want to believe it . No way . Instead , you turn it into fiction with welldone special effects . And the actors are so good it 's scary . This abstraction gives you distance and control , and sleep acts as a commercial break . " Now back to our regularly scheduled war , already in progress , " is one of Chester 's favorite lines . But this is n't working for Laraby . Things are slipping into an absurd equation where he 's equivalent with Sarajevo . Each atrocity is part of his own evolution , almost like childhood memories recovered by a spurious quack , and he watches and rewatches the unwatchable videos , sometimes staying up all night in front of the monitor-Did this really happen ? Of course it did-over and over again . There 's the zoo , a lovely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today its animals are getting butchered for much-needed meat . The monkey house is a den of almost-human screams . Dead elephants are chainsawed for their flesh . The untender birds , mostly carrion , are freed to starve on their own or to scavenge off those unclaimed . Jesus . These images flicker through the sleepless night like a nightmare . It is n't cruelty-you have to tell yourself thatit 's awful necessity . The keeper , an old man , twenty-five years with this zoo , aims the shotgun at the caged tiger 's head . Nothing to be done . Laraby hits rewind , play , rewind again . A loop to the polar bears . The footage is purposeless . No one wants to see it . Too much grit for back home . Plus the fearful lack of civility , the giant leap of regression , all that crap is a bummer to a humanist nation . But Zev , through his many connections , has managed to scramble up some zebra meat for the four of them . It 's tough , charbroiled to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Except for Laraby . " You know , I once drank bat 's blood in Cambodia , " Chester says , beginning to spill his usual stories of Disgusting Meals Eaten . " That was the worst . " McGraw disagrees . " But they 're bats , " he says . " Who gives a shit about a bat ? " " It tasted awful . " The three of them are sipping peppermint schnapps , a rarity here . Zev found it on the black market , a whole case . He also found a jar of Hellman 's mayonnaise and ten rolls of Italian toilet paper , Di Prima Classe , a soft two-ply brand . A sufficiently stoned Zev walks back to the table , his eyes pink , his grouper mouth sucking in air . He tops off their glasses , greeting them with , " Ziveli . And how is the zebra tonight ? " " Excellent . " " Dobro , vrlo dobro . " He 's been their translator for a couple of months-the old translator , a guy named Alija , suffered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep this job for as long as possible . It pays well . There are benefits . And the Hilton has no more need for an assistant concierge . " Anyway , " Chester continues , " they bring the bat to your table , holding it by the wings so you can see the wingspan . That 's very important for some reason . Then they whack it a good one on the head and bleed it into a glass . It 's meant to be a delicacy . " " Why drink it ? " " Keeps your dick hard for a week . " " Cat 's the worst thing I ever ate , " McGraw says . " The family cat . Snowball . " " Sta ? " " My father kind of flipped out and did some terrible things . " McGraw immediately regrets bringing up this memory , of his father serving dinner , those greasy pieces of kitty meat , to his wife and kids , and forcing the six of them to clean their plates . " The family cat ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncertain of falling . " That 's cold . I 've eaten cat and dog-in fact , I 've probably eaten just about every variety of pet there is-but never the family pet , or a family pet . That 's , that 's bad . Anyone ever see that movie King Rat ? " No one has . Laraby is still thinking about bat 's blood and a daylong boner . Would that be pleasurable ? And then his mind settles on cruel tortures he used to inflict on the neighborhood animals : Throwing rocks at dogs . Putting two cats in a potato sack . Blowing up seagulls with M-80s . Why do you do those things ? " Was your cock ? " Zev asks . " What ? " Zev gestures to his groin and makes an adaptation of a fascist salute . " Nada . " Chester refills his glass , hoping nobody sees him drink this candy booze . Disgusting . And the translator pours with such a maitre d " flourish and clinks glasses every chance he gets . " The family cat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to hear . He stares into the zebra meat-Shena , Queen of the Jungle had a zebra for wheels , kind of a pet , though McGraw is n't too fond of the whole noble savage motif in comics . Except Conan . He says , " Why did n't they let the tiger loose in the Serengeti pen ? That would 've been something . " " A Bengal , " Zev answers . " Fucking Indian , not African . " " Let him stretch his legs one last time . Let him get a taste of the old country . Let him hunt and chase and rip apart . That would 've been something to see . Instead of the shotgun . " McGraw slides the meat into his mouth : the kill . The animal would probably just sit there , stuck with a new fear , too scared of those high-to-the-ground creatures . No doubt . Fifteen years in the zoo , sleeping and eating , cooled off in the summer and kept warm in the winter , you forget the real you and fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a you without painful realizations . But who says this is n't the life to lead ? The four of them basically agree . " But it 'd be nice to show your real power . The tiger did n't move as the keeper took aim . Did he know ? A stupid question . It 's not like being pursued , adrenaline pumping , running because genetically you have to run until those claws swipe your hind quarters and you fall and tumble and within seconds you hear things tear and you feel things spill and you know things are over . No , the tiger did n't flinch . McGraw had held the close-up on the face , a brutal shot , and off-camera you could hear the click of the pump action and the crazy moaning of the keeper . Boom . That was one heavy-duty gun . And Laraby had the perfect copy : executions , like zoos , are the sole property of humans . Then the tiger shook as if shocked and backed itself in the corner , blood all over the place . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cat . " Chester is still fixated . He can get that way , waltz with a thought through a whole set of topics . " Yeah . " " Was it off the bone at least ? " " I really ca n't remember . " Outside the shelling starts again , the hills raining mortars on the entrenched city . This noise makes Laraby nervous-he ca n't quite get used to it-and though there 's no danger of a possible hit-the Serbs are targeting the southern section-he stops eating and looks up at the ceiling . Things quiver slightly . The silver ware on the plates . The hanging lights . Like the nearing of a merciless army from Megiddo . Frightening . With natural disasters he had arrived after the fact , the destruction laid out in front of him . Except the fires . The fires he witnessed , but it was always from a distance and it was always beautiful . The fires he actually enjoyed . Certain colors exist only in fire-he discovered this early on , as a kid , a little pyro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . And sometimes he 'd cut his fingernails and cut clumps of his hair , and he 'd burn that in a small pile . An awful stench of himself emerged , sweet and thick and oily . " But wait , " Chester asks , " did you know it was Snowball ? " " Not really . I do n't know . Let 's drop it , okay . " The shells hit in clockwork fashion . And Laraby listens intently . It is n't that he imagines screams-that sensation will come later-but it 's something else , a different noise , like when you hear voices , in the shower , in an airplane 's engine , in an electric shaver , and the voices are calling for you , trying to find you . An eerie feeling . And as Laraby spends more time in this city , a weird place of diffuse civilizations and bloods held in the sexless crotch of the hills , the voices become louder . " Did you puke when you found out ? " " No , okay . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You guys want to smoke ? " McGraw- " Yes " -quickly answers . The seals were particularly hard to kill . The tank had been drained of the long-neglected water , green for months , but the seals were quick and they hid in the large rock formation that acted as their artificial home . The keeper slipped on the slimy bottom , his shotgun discharging in the air . A crowd of reporters gathered . The animals barked and pushed themselves deeper into the crevices . They knew what was coming-dying screams do n't need to be translated from species to species . Laraby leaned over the rail , his feet bobbing up and down . The whole scene was almost comical . A few of them were easy to kill ; they were older and lazier and almost let the gun rest against their sleek heads . But the rest were a bitch : seals from an overcrowded Scottish zoo , North Sea seals . The keeper had trouble with their upland names-MacGregor , Glasgow-and it all sounded absurd , not just his pronunciation but his trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he had a fish , one of those rubber novelty gifts . He waved it in the air , as if teasing for a trick . The reward . Laraby glanced about in shock . Chester and McGraw were side by side like a drummer and a bass player in a wedding band . Zev was off with one of the other keepers-they were shooting the pigeons that lingered by the fountains . Just the other day parents and children were coming to this zoo to try to forget themselves . Now the seals were the only ones left-four of them , to be exact-each wedged in the hollow of the middle , each hungry for even a fake herring . A thick smoke joins the air . For a second Laraby thinks he 's smelling himself burn , or maybe others . McGraw passes the pipe to Chester . " The cat " -he shakes his head " just blows me away . " " Shut up . " " This the fucking best , " says Zev . " Trust me . You can function , no fucking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up three rolls of Di Prima Classe . The remaining seals were eventually killed and skinned , their blubber used for burning oil , their fatty meat fed to children . The butcher did everything by guesswork , though he was completely baffled by the giraffes . And McGraw captured all of it on tape . They taped everything . Even Laraby 's death . Still long-haired and thin and quiet for the last couple of days before he died . Something was bothering him , that 's what the three of them would say later . He was depressed . Or just lonely . Distant . Who knows ? But as he interviewed a woman about her prized collection of porcelain plates- " It 's a miracle that none of your things have broken during the incessant shelling " -Laraby rubbed his head , his temple , his left eye , and within seconds his appendages , including ears , felt as if they were retracting into his skull in a blinding flash . His last thought : Spontaneous combustion ! Right here ! What a way to go ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A plate was taken down with him-a commemorative Royal Wedding plate , 1956 , the Prince and Princess of Monaco posed in the center-but he cradled it safely to his chest , like a lover 's picture , Grace peeking over his arm . Cause of death : an aneurysm . Expired in less than a minute . The woman , wearing her best clothes and a ton of makeup , crouched over him and tried to prod him back to life while McGraw kept shooting and Zev considered taking a hockey stick to this fragile place and Chester wished , for an instant , that it could have been a sniper 's bullet that brought down his reporter , or a devastating mortar , or an angry mob pissed off at America 's indifference . Something sexy with legs . III I watched one for a long time , till half its body was buried ; I then walked up and pulled it by the tail ; at this it was greatly astonished , and soon shuffled up to see what was the matter ; and then stared me in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What made you pull my tail ? " . . . I threw it . . . as far as I could , into a deep pool left by the retiring tide . -Charles Darwin This is n't a paradise . More like a barbecue on the verge of igniting . The airport 's tarmac smells of spilt diesel , and the distant lava , long hardened , menaces with spent fury a la late Joan Crawford . The First Lady 's a bit late . Nothing new . It 's around five in the afternoon . Still hot . Not much of a breeze . The sun is giving no hints of ever leaving the sky , and the earth , or this fat part bulging at the seam , sucks it up with forced devotion . It could be autumn , winter , spring , or summer . The weather never changes . A crowd has gathered , about sixty people corralled behind a wooden barricade . The front line belongs to the press , print and TV , mostly South American , ready to capture the taxiing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Behind them are second-tier dignitaries too lowly to actually greet anyone . Plus a few naturalists and soldiers thrown into the mix . Finally , towards the back , children and young women act as filler , their small American flags lazy at their sides . A floral melange of tourists has also joined them , but these individuals look out of place , as if they 're hostages waylaid en route to a Club Med . Everyone is staring into flat blue space . The camera their locus , Chester , McGraw , and Zev stand unsteadily together , press credentials fastened to their pants . Against protocol , their shirts are off because it 's hot and they 're not used to being hot and having their shirts off . It makes them happy even though a lot of the tourists bitch about the constant heat . But what do you expect ? It 's the fucking equator . The guys laugh at this . They 've been laughing for the last hour-setting up the tripod , talking to the advance crew , meeting the reporter from Brasilia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cockroaches . " Jesus , I hate these things ! " Chester shrieks . One of the bugs has landed on his head , the creature 's podites getting caught in his curly hair . With spastic motions he quickly sweeps it off . " Where 'd it go ? " " Fucking what ? " Zev asks . " The cockroach . " " I hate those things , " says McGraw . " Dammit , that 's not fair . " Chester tenses his jaw and turbans his shirt around his head . " Bastard 's uncatchable . " But that 's what happens when you have no natural predators-you develop hobbies , like flying . Chester hates such insectile advancement . Plain cockroaches are bad enough , but when they 're airborne it seems positively postapocalyptic . And who started doomsday and did n't tell him ? What 's next ? Dog-walking fleas . . . dieting tapeworms . . . hairstyling lice ? As a kid he sometimes had problems getting to sleep , imagining the millions of microbes nibbling on his body , the amoebae dining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take-out meal . " Why the hell do they have to fly ? " Chester asks . McGraw answers with a " Why not ? " " Rats do n't fly . " " Fucking pigeons , " Zev says . " More like bats . I think bats are closer to rats , so they 'd be considered the flying rat . " " It rhymes at least . " " No , " Zev interrupts . " Bats are fucking mammals . Closer to us . Pigeons are flying rats . No bullshit , trust me . I killed enough to know . They 're stupid and dirty , circling those fountains until they 're all fucking dead and on the ground . And the women still happy for food . " This ends the conversation . Zev 's gravy-thick voice has a way of doing this . Everything he says sounds so tragic and final . An airplane breaks through the blue and someone shouts and points to the sky like a sailor on the prow of the Pinta . Soon everyone is shouting and pointing to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locked down and ready to grasp the ground . The people are so excited , you 'd think it 's the first time they 've seen such a thing . Chester wonders how Laraby would 've described it , the glittering metal , the anticipation . Back home , his death was received with little fanfare . The autopsy betrayed a congenital condition , a hidden glitch he was born with , and it was just a matter of time before the bug in the brain burst to life . Sure , there was coverage , his photograph and his dates , a brief homage to his brief career , the anchor concluding the report with **30;212;TOOLONG . But that was it . They did n't even show the video of his brief spasms , his rolledback eyes , his grimaced mouth . Too morbid , they told Chester . No need to turn it into a tabloid event . But if it was a bullet that ripped through his brain instead of an arterial dilatation , if the blood was all external instead of internal , shooting into the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then maybe it 'd be the lead story , a special report , a bulletin . No parachute journalismjump in , tape the segment , and take the next flight home-but a literal deadline , a perfect mix of subjective and objective news , a reporter as victim , as casualty , as sacrifice to the event itself . In the end , Chester felt gypped , like a boy robbed of the game-winning hit because the pitcher threw a tricky strike . The plane lands with the finesse of an albatross-bump , bump , thud-then turns and taxis towards the specified greeting zone . " What are you going to do ? " Chester asks McGraw . " It 's pretty difficult . " " Get her deplaning . That 's our establishing shot . " " Of course . " Chester consults a clipboard even though it tells him nothing . The logistics are not complex . Just follow her around . Watch her linger next to the sea lions , her face all smiles at their aquatic adorableness . Watch her mourn the short cruel life of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her laugh at the marine iguanas , so prehistoric , so bizarre , as they swim with their tails sweeping the water , their heads poking from the surface the same way Mother laps the community pool . Watch her take note of the saddle-back tortoise , steadfast and consistent , like a politician she knows . " Molim , a little rest , " says Zev before slumping to the hot ground , his huge body falling the way Robert Mitchum used to fall , with inevitability . " Fucking sleep , " he mutters . Arms curl around the hot metal of the tripod , hands lock , and he looks up and imagines , for a frozen second , that he 's being trampled by a lethargic crowd . At least there are no pigeons here . The plane , a custom 727 , eases to a stop . Engines rev down in a fading tone , almost mournful . After the gangway is affixed to the fuselage 's front door , the red carpet is quite literally rolled out . That 's when the taped music begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flags-plastic Stars and Stripes stapled to dowelsare lifted and flapped , each one designed to sustain maximum enthusiasm at cheapest cost . Chester thinks about moving the camera back a bit and placing some children in the lower foreground , blurry yet eager , the tops of their heads bouncing with glee . But what 's the point ? Right now he does n't feel like moving . Not ever . Not in a million years . Not until something has changed in him . A new adaptation . Orderly teeth . A solid chin . Trustworthy eyes . The door opens . Starting to shoot , McGraw centers on the door . If in some backward countries a photograph steals your soul , what the hell would this do ? He could wreak havoc with the tribes of the rain forest , all without destroying a thing . Videoman . After a while , two secret service agents emerge , their habits ingrained in everyone 's head : dark glasses , plain suits , fingers in ear , mouths to sleeve ; they take the stairs with suspicion . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a genuine smile of It 's Great to Be Here in the Galapagos . She pauses at the top , her khaki outfit perfect for these parts . " Holy shit . " A jolt moves through Chester . " Are you getting this ? " " Yeah . " " It 's a miracle . " Moving closer to the camera , wanting to be sure it 's working , trying not to step on Zev . " I ca n't believe this . It 's better than the Challenger . " The First Lady descends . " Get the legs . " " Sure . " " But do n't make it obvious . " She 's wearing shorts , maybe for the first time since becoming First Lady . Not maybe , definitely . Because look at those legs ! Blotchy white skin , some of it curdled , pouring out of khaki . Thighs as big as pillows . Bowed knees that probably have n't touched since she was a teenager . Shins ? There are no shins , only calves . " I had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shoes . It 's Zev resting his head . " I knew about the ankles . But not this . " The First Lady greets the people waiting below , shaking hands with dignitaries and accepting flowers from a nervous girl , a tiny thing , who starts to cry uncontrollably , her face creased with five-year-old misery . " The networks are going to shoot themselves for missing this . So are the tabloids . I bet they open with this , or maybe not this , but they 'll get to this sooner rather than later . Inside Edition , Hard Copy , they 'd start right here . Get some fitness experts , maybe the Buns of Steel woman . Or Richard Simmons could do his shtick , driving up to the White House in the Deal-a-Meal van . " The First Lady picks up the girl , the girl 's arms wrapping around her neck , the girl 's face burying under her chin . They rock together . " Really go tight on the gams . " " How tight ? " " To the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zooms in with terrifying speed , pushing aside any distance with a mere touch of his finger .

##1003713 Teepeed inside three sticks and a sheet in the shaggy side grass , grass our father refused to cut and by June already knee-high , waisthigh , chest-high , we watched the street for George 's mother 's car . Noah squinted through the safety-pinned teepee door , whispering the name of each car as it passed . " Pontiac , " he said , " Ford , Datsun , something . " I pressed my face against the worn spots on the sheet , breathing detergent and closet and sun on warm cloth . Through the pale shadow of fabric , our house-where fans circled in windows , where in the kitchen , I knew , our mother set pencils and paper and heavy schoolbooks on the table , scraping two chairs close together . Through the windows we heard music , faint on heated air , and our father , I knew , sat with closed eyes in the living room . Sun blazed on clapboards where paint dangled in strips . Bugs hummed and buzzed in the grass all around us . Sprinklers chattered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrunched down to cool , sneakerpacked dirt . " Buick , " Noah whispered . " Buick Skylark .

" George 's mother 's car . " I squirmed to the ground near the teepee door and looked through the grass , Noah behind me . First George 's mother got out of the car and walked around to George 's side . She opened the door and we watched her help George swing his leg out . For a minute everything was arms , her pocketbook dangling from her shoulder , George 's red face , his crutches .

Then , when George tucked them under his arms , we stared at the empty leg of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not breathe . I could feel Noah 's hand , where it touched my sneaker , clenching and unclenching . George 's mother smoothed out her skirt with her hands . She hitched her purse to her shoulder . Pleats and wrinkles , a plaid blouse , sandals , a scarf , and curled hair-she walked beside George to our front door . Before they reached it our mother would always open it , holding the screen door wide with her white arm . From where we spied we could hear the spring stretch . We could hear the music inside our house . We could hear the scuff of George 's foot on the walk . <p> Heads cocked , we could hear the rattle of a bike fender over a pothole , the bark of a chained dog , the ring of a telephone-a radio three houses down , cars one street over , an airplane a mile up , but never the soft press of rubber-tipped crutches on our own front walk . " Hi , Mrs. Miller , " George always said , and , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always said . Then George would step through our door , shrinking into the dark of our house . Our mother eased the screen door closed behind them , never letting it bang shut . George 's mother would get into her car and pull away from the curb . <p> Once , we waited in the shade of the garage on our bikes and pedaled after George 's mother 's car as she drove it away-hands a splay of white knuckles on handlebars , tires a hum and blur on flashes of pavement . Forward and low for speed , we tucked our heads to breathe so we would n't inhale bugs . Reflections of leafy branches and telephone wires slid across the rear glass of George 's mother 's car , cresting hills and doubling corners , further and further ahead of us each time we looked up . <p> Our father was another story . <p> In our father 's story I would tell you how we stepped , toe and shuffle , through the living room dark , not looking to where he sat on the couch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at two-thirty , at three-thirty , at five . In his story I would tell you the names I read when he was n't there , the names I was not sure how to turn into sound : Bartok , Schubert , Stravinsky . <p> Chopin , I would show you , holding up the shiny square of cardboard , letting you gift the word with your own voice . Of closed eyes , of feet resting on newspapers stacked on the coffee table , I would tell ' you nothing . <p> Of shaggy side grass , of gray sneakers toed-through and smoothsoled , of night coughs and backseat thirsts , of dogs and basketball and go-carts , I had learned to say nothing . <p> When Noah started to tell Dean and Todd Stamoulis of the cellar door , I clapped a hand over his mouth , twisted him to pine-needled dirt in the woods behind Dean and Todd Stamoulis 's house , and rolled him into a pricker bush . After that Noah would tell you nothing , either . A foot-cracked cellar door , marked with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell . <p> " Mom , " we asked , " what 's wrong with George ? " " Wrong with George ? " she would say . " Is there something wrong with George ? " <p> " Mom , " Noah would say-rolled eyes and giggle . " What happened ? " As he said it I would look at him , thinking I saw him as I imagined our mother saw both of us right then : lips mustached with Kool-Aid , hands and fingers smudged with dirt , legs tanned and skinny swinging from the edge of the chair . <p> Our mother would turn to stir a spoon in a pot , to cross her arms and look out the window . She would lick a fingertip , peel and flip a magazine page . I would grab hold of Noah and pull him from his chair , dragging him outside to where the teepee sagged in the sun . <p> The summer of watching George became the summer of shirtless men and trucks along our street , of asphalt and backhoe and settling dust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caverns and quick drops-of pavement in cracked piles , of the smell and spread of hot tar , stuck and clumped to sneakered feet . Machines split the air into pieces like glass . Men painted lines on the street and jackhammered seams in concrete . <p> Noah and I stretched our limbs on teepee-shaded dirt , feeling the shake and thrum of earth in our stomachs , the pulse of blood in our ears . <p> In our house , windows squealed down on dusty sash cords and curtains slumped shut . In the living room , tables and chairs moved away from doors always left open . Doors closed with a rusty click of hasp and hinge . <p> That summer became the summer of Dvorak and Debussy , the summer of tent caterpillars and leafless branches , of nights the sound of caterpillars eating became the sound of rain . That summer became the summer Noah and I scissored our shorts into patches to mend teepee cloth frayed by sun and rain and sticks , the summer Noah and I wore long pants and tucked-in shirts like George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things before it became the fall . <p> About George , our mother would tell us only that his mother was not his real mother . <p> " Farm machinery , " she said , " all right ? Now drop it , " she said to us one other time . <p> About our father , I would tell you only that at supper , our mother carried a plate of food into the closed-off living room-only that when she came back to eat with us , we ate to the sound of music . The crutches we imagined leaning against the back of George 's chair , against the wall our mother had pencil-slashed and dated as Noah and I grew , against ragged coupons thumbtacked to plasteror lying on the floor beneath the table where our mother and George sat . <p> " Reading comprehension , spelling , grammar , " our mother said , when we asked about days inside with George , about drawn shades and cool shadow for concentration , but we heard the swell of our mother 's laughter , we saw the Scrabble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , after George had gone . " Now , write a story using all these words , " we heard our mother 's voice say . <p> The rest we could imagine : the two chairs angled together , the feet bumping under the table , the smell of our mother 's hair as she swished it from her face . <p> Teepeed on days George did n't come , I showed Noah the heavy schoolbooks , the small black letters and words , the pencil notes in the white spaces . <p> " Malice , " I said to Noah , " mammoth , manufacture , marvelous . " Later , one-legged and crutchless , Noah and I hopped through lilacs , through snags and snares of grass behind the house , along the driveway ; past cinderblock garages , cobwebbed windows , curls of ivy , and back . <p> " Who is that ? " Dean and Todd Stamoulis and Dean and Todd Stamoulis ' s cousin had asked one night , pointing , as along our street streetlights blinked on , as mothers stood behind screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . On our front walk stood a man , hands by his sides , face turned up to sky . <p> In dusk , the man could have been any man-a man come to sharpen our knives and repair our pots , to read an electric meter , to sell potato peelers , to preach the path and the word . In dusk , the man may have been wearing a suit and a knotted tie , a hat perhaps , to keep the sun off his face as he walked , all day , from door to door ; a hat to crease and pull low over his eyes as at nightfall he curled beneath a bush to sleep . In dusk , the man could have been only the shadow of another man who stood somewhere else . Then I saw that the man was my father . <p> Dean Stamoulis was bouncing a tennis ball against the smootheddown curb . <p> " I do n't know , " I said . <p> This was one night of a different summer-a summer of firecrackers and bottle rockets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of afternoons at Elm Park-a summer our father still stepped outside to moving air and noise , a summer that he still sat at the wheel of the car and Noah and I in the backseat , both of us watching the wheel turn in his hands as we drove through that summer 's dark . <p> I could not see what in the sky the man was studying , what , on our front walk , he was doing . " If not his real mother , who ? " we asked , following our mother through airless rooms , past windows closed and locked , past sills of bugs back-flat and curled . Music followed the rhythm of our feet on the floor . <p> About George , I would tell you what I imagined : a rotted-out porch , a wasps ' nest , simple food , cornfields , dry dirt . A two-lane stretch of blacktop , a green tractor , nothing wasted : a scarecrow dressed in George 's half-shredded pants . <p> A boy , I had heard my mother say , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boys , " our father said , some night , catching us leaning , mid-step , in living room dark . <p> " Wait , " he said . " Listen . There , that phrase . Variations on a motif . Hear it ? " <p> The living room a clutter of end tables and chairs skewed on the lumped-up rug , a falling-down pile of newspapers , a clot of shadow , the scratch and hiss of vinyl . We watched our father 's fingers trace the melody through air . We waited for the arm to lift from the record and swing to , snapping-in the hushed dark , for our father 's eyes to open again . <p> From behind porch rail , paint cracking off on palms , from behind the spray of hemlock , what we saw was Mr. Clemens next door and our mother , talking . Mr. Clemens : arms folded on the rust-speckled handle of his lawnmower . <p> Our mother : waisted in shaggy side grass . From the mower shot bits of grass . Mr. Clemens 's sneaker-tips were stained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the growl and whine of mower , the shudder of machines along our street , the shouts of men , the wild shrill of bugs . The air stank of hot asphalt and bleeding grass . <p> The teepee our mother folded up-pale , barkless sticks and patched sheets trailing from her arms as she walked back to the house . <p> We heard the mower blade catch on grass . In the living room , in two-thirty dark , our father heard music . Next day , we stepped outside to heaps of cut grass , to a circle of bare earth . <p> The place we saw George go , the end of that summer , was awayhis face , through glass , turned frontways , his crutches leaned against his chest . The mother not his mother drove , steering past orange pylons and blinking sawhorses , past men leaning on spades who lifted sweated caps to scratch . <p> What we saw , from anywhere we cared to spy , was everything . " George 's mother 's car , " Noah whispered . Forgotten , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spokes spiderwebbed . <p> Dust choked our throats , soft and bitter on our tongues . Our father , by then , had been gone a week . Him we had not watched go , going as he had in the dark , in the night , and now we focused on the blur of George 's red face-our hands , had he turned to look , waving goodbye . <p> In George 's story I would tell you not of a farmer 's son , not of a farmer 's wife , not of heads bowed round a supper table , but of waving fields of green , of the sound of two feet smacking packed earth as they ran . I would tell you of a farm where the only machines sat quiet and rusted in the long grass that covered everything , of a place where what had been done had been undone . I would tell you a story of crutches whittled down to teepee sticks and draped with colored cloth-a story of a house lit-up at streetlight time on summer nights , a story of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , inside this house , once upon a time . I would tell you , I hope , a story of boys , in the month before blackboards and books , a story of the time before the only music was the classroom music of words copied and spoken aloud . <p> 
##1003714 Travel light . I think it is essential these days to travel light , do you not agree ? It avoids so much unnecessary delay at terminals . You will need , after all , no more than what you can wear : gloves , a dark raincoat ; perhaps a hat with a brim to conceal your face . <p> You need not come equipped . I will provide the equipment . Naturally , there is the question of what we will use . I have thought of everything . I keep it in a French provincial armoire , what they call an armoire bombee . It will supply us both . <p> Did you simply go to the kitchen and take the knife ? According to Cook , you were rummaging in a drawer with a preoccupied expression on your face in the middle of luncheon . She did not question you , of course . She thought you might have been hunting for a corkscrew or some remedy for indigestion . Mother had gone to her room to take her afternoon rest . <p> On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no man 's land , beyond sight and sound . Do not allow anyone to disturb you . Indulge in a preparatory rest . Lean back in your seat . Relax and enjoy the flight , as the steward always recommends . Ask him for a blanket , a pillow , a glass of Scotch . You might even indulge , under appropriate cover , in a little preparatory enjoyment . I recommend it as a way of avoiding over-excitement at the crucial moment . You will see what I have laid on in preparation for your coming . There will be flowers , even a few white orchids for the occasion . <p> Mother rose that afternoon from her rest to the bitter smell of zinnias in the damp air . We learned as girls , you know , that one never decorates a table with zinnias because of their bitter smell . She went for a walk in the garden . It was there that she found the body , which she took for a moment in her shock and confusion to be mine . She saw the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been pierced so that the entrails had tumbled into the long grass . The ants had already begun to crawl in them . <p> My sister would have grasped greedily at her pierced stomach when she was stabbed . She would have held her blue entrails up to the afternoon light . She would have run her fingers through them as we used to run our fingers through Mother 's jewels . <p> You realize that I get what I want . My sister was only the appetizer . Mornings , I would thrust my arm into the dark of the drawer in Mother 's desk . I would take out her Craven A tin from the back of the drawer and run my fingers through the jewels . I would lift them up to the light . " You can have the yellow diamond , and I will have the blue , " I would say to my sister , but in the end I got them all . <p> I would lie with Mother on her silk bedspread , sucking on her slack breasts , while my sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with that absent expression , eating slice after slice of anchovy toast cut into finger-thin strips . <p> Though my color was good , I was told I was anemic and needed to rest on my bed with a book in the afternoons . My sister , despite her natural pallor , was told to pull herself together and get some exercise . On car trips I sat in the back beside Mother , my head on her lap , smelling the faint bitter scent of her sex through her thin , flowered dress while she read me fairy tales . My sister , in the front with the driver , leaned out the window and counted the cornstalks . <p> It was I who was presented to the queen at the Court of Saint James with pomp and ceremony , my thick hair piled high on my head . The presentation photograph hangs on my bedroom wall . I wore a scarlet satin dress with a decolletage that caught the prince 's eye . When I came up to curtsey , he stopped nodding off and leaned forward from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effort , do n't you think ? <p> The voyage will give you time to read this correspondence again . Be guided by it . The act is transcribed here like a symphony , every note in place . Enjoy the music . Think of me as the concertmaster who leads his orchestral colleagues from their midst . I will set the music in motion . You , as the conductor , will provide the structure to our pleasure . <p> Imagine our meeting . I see your plane circling in the mist . I see you stepping into a taxi at the terminal , leaning forward to direct the driver to the Gare du Nord . The taxi creeps forward at first and then races . The driver shifts gears abruptly , as they do in Paris , and stops short before the lights . You are jostled and bone-tired . I see you standing at the ticket counter , raising your eyebrows at the price of the ticket . You find a single seat by the window . You see the bare arms of trees spread supplicant against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and down on the platform . The sky is naked , the air raw . Your throat is dry from the long flight . Someone asks for a match . You watch it flicker and go out . It is growing dark . <p> Mother said she found the body amongst the zinnias in the late afternoon . She crouched down and cradled it in her arms , as if my sister were still a child . She pressed the face against her breasts , as if to comfort her . She felt the blood seep through the flowers on her dress . She felt like the murderer with all that blood on her . Then she was not sure what to do . She laid the body back on the ground . Only then did she realize that it was my sister and not I lying there , carved up like a white lamb . <p> When you arrive here it will be snowing . Watch the flakes , shapeless and slow , drift to the ground . A flake falls on your face like the light touch of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the train . On foot you follow the river northward . The river is swollen with snow . You cross the bridge and see the lights fragmented on the dark , fast-moving water . You shiver a little . You would like a drink . You wonder if the people are watching you from behind drawn shutters . <p> You come to the iron railings of the public gardens . The gilt tips shine in the lamplight . You are startled by the dry sound of the beating of wings as a nightjar rises into the air . The convent bells toll the hour . From the garden side of the street you look up at this house . From the front it appears that all of the rooms are dark . The paint is peeling from the front door . The bronze knocker , once shaped like an animal 's paw , is worn to a stump . You hesitate . You proceed around to the back garden , and you see the light in my room . <p> The day of my arrival you had drawn the curtains on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my sister to come back for luncheon . Mother said that she was not worried , that my sister did not always come back at midday . You seemed distracted . Mother supposed it was the wind . The wind was blowing grains of sand up against the panes . You did not pour her sherry , although the cutglass decanters were laid out on the silver tray . She poured her own . <p> My sister had said she was going into town for the day and would not be back . If she had kept to her plan , what would you have done ? Were you so determined ? Did it have to be that day ? <p> We will not be subject to chance . We will plan in advance . We will structure the scene . I will see that nothing goes amiss . We will take our time . We will neither rush nor will we draw things out unbearably . Timing , of course , is essential . I will tell you when to begin . I will keep my wits . I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feverish . Her dress was unbuttoned , her straw hat in her hand . Dust covered her sandals . Her white curls clung to her damp forehead . You went into the dark dining room and sat down to eat . You rose from the table in the middle of the meal , napkin in hand , and went into the kitchen , Mother said . <p> Did I mention that I spoke to my sister on the telephone after I , at last , arose ? She had called from town for my advice . I reassured her and told her to return at luncheon . She was grateful . Perhaps she anticipated the event that was to follow . <p> You will come through the back gate , remembering to slip your fingers through the creeper and lift the lever . You know I am waiting . The back door opens with the first light touch of your fingers . You hesitate , looking back at your footprints in the snow . You peer into the dim light of a long vestibule . You smell the dampness and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vestibule . There is an impression of light , as there is when one approaches the sea from the woods . You hear pages turning . The damp , uneven floor slopes downward as you creep forward uncertainly , like a blind man drawn toward the light . <p> You enter this large , well-lit room . It is warm and quiet . Your eyes adjust to the light . You see bookshelves , a drop-leaf desk by the window , a fern in a brass-studded pot , a fire . Beside it I have laid a low table and set out silver candelabra , polished to a high shine . Candles will add a touch of drama to the scene . You see me standing by the window , staring out at the snow . At first you can not see my face , as it is turned from you . You watch me draw the cream silk curtains slowly over one window and then the next . Then I turn toward you but do not acknowledge your presence . You look at the fine cheekbones , the high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you remember calling me once . <p> Do you remember the two sisters waltzing around the dining table ? The silver bowl with ripe peaches and plums glinted in the sunlight . The room smelled of overripe fruit , honeysuckle , and jasmine . The warm trade wind blew through the open window . The white web of the curtains billowed , and the crocheted tablecloth fluttered around the rim . The sisters waltzed around the table to the " Graduation Ball , " dipping and rising , throwing heads back and forth , linked and laughing , full skirts , lace petticoats , soft hair swirling in the white light like foam . They glided across the shiny , slippery floor . The younger girl 's cheeks were flushed , her skin shone , and she called out to stop in her woozy , urgent , high-pitched voice , but the elder sister had her firmly by the waist ; she held her sister 's thighs pressed against her own . <p> You can see my sister in the way I move and in the way my lips curve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflects the light of the fire . I am wearing something red , diaphanous , with all my diamonds . You see my bare feet on the carpet as I turn and come toward you slowly . You watch my breasts rise and fall . You look up . Above me you notice the arched ceiling and the green light . <p> You think you have found the entrance to paradise . <p>
